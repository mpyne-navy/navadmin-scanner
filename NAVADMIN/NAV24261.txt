RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Reserve Maritime 
Space Officer (MSO) designator (1875) within the Information Warfare 
Community (IWC). 
 
2.  Reserve MSO establishment is a major milestone in building out the 
overall Navy space community.  Reserve MSOs complement and augment the Active 
Duty MSO community as the maritime space integration and planning 
professionals of the Navy, providing a unique combination of prior warfare 
qualification, operational experience, and fundamental knowledge and 
background in space-related capabilities. Reserve MSOs also often bring 
extensive civilian space expertise - from the intelligence community, DoD 
agencies, other government agencies, and the full spectrum of innovative 
corporations - to enhance the application of space capabilities to maritime 
operations.  A unified Active and Reserve MSO community is critical to 
achieving national security objectives through the integration of space 
capabilities into maritime operations and plans. 
 
3.  Reserve MSOs will be members of the IWC and assigned globally to fill key 
space oriented positions throughout the Fleet, to include Navy Maritime 
Operation Centers, Navy Warfighting Development Centers, U.S. Space Command, 
the National Intelligence Community and the Information Warfare Type Command. 
 
4.  The Reserve Component (RC) MSO/1875 Community will conduct an initial 
redesignation panel in Fiscal Year 2024 for conversion to MSO. Subsequent 
Change of Designator requests will be accepted on a rolling basis.  All 
applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in reference (b). 
Officers with documented space education/training, space cadre qualification, 
and/or civilian space experience are eligible to apply.  Interested 
applicants can find application requirements and procedures posted on 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Officer/Reserve-OCM/Selected-Reservists/RC-IWC/. All applicants 
require concurrence from their respective (losing) reserve officer Community 
Managers prior to submitting an application.  All applicants must be able to 
obtain a top secret/sensitive compartmented information security clearance. 
Interested officers should contact the RC point of contact in paragraph 6. 
 
5.  Applicants will be notified of their selection status once the initial 
list of MSO accessions has been approved.
