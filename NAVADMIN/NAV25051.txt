2.  AC Senior Chief Petty Officers (SCPO) converting into CMDCS rating will 
be converted upon release of this screening message and are immediately no 
longer eligible for promotion in their source rating.  SCPOs shall verify 
rating conversion via their Enlisted Service Record (ESR) on NSIPS.   If 
rating conversion has not reflected within 10 days of results release, 
members are advised to contact the AC CSEL Enlisted Community Manager (ECM).
SCPOs will be required to contact the AC CSEL detailer to negotiate for 
orders and to request a quota for the Command Master Chief/Chief of the Boat 
(CMC/COB) Course.  Once a CMDCS is in receipt of orders, they must obligate 
the required length of service within 30 days.
Failure to OBLISERVE within the prescribed 30 days, will result in immediate 
cancellation of orders.  CMDCSs will not be awarded the 8CSC NEC, nor wear 
the CMDCS identification badge, until they have successfully completed the 
CMC/COB course.

3.  Congratulations to the following Training and Administration of the 
Reserve (TAR)/Selected Reserve (SELRES) members who have been selected for
