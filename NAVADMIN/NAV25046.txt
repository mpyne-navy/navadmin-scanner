RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides supplemental guidance to reference (a).  
Reference (b) is canceled, and all hands shall be made immediately aware of 
this guidance.

2.  Approval Timeline and Appeals.  Reference (a) provides the methodology 
that must be applied for the approval of administrative absence or funded 
travel for non-covered Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).
    a.  Approval Timeline.  Commanding Officers (CO) or approval authorities 
must act promptly and with appropriate discretion when considering a request 
for administrative absence or funded Temporary Duty (TDY) travel.  If a 
command structure does not have a designated CO, the approval authority is 
defined as the head of the unit, activity, or organization who holds command 
and control authority.  Due to the time-sensitive nature of non-covered ART, 
approval decisions should be made no later than 5 days after the request is 
submitted.
    b.  Appeal Process.  If the CO or approval authority denies the 
administrative absence or funded travel for non-covered ART:
        (1) the CO or approval authority must notify the first
O6/GS15 or higher Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC), and
        (2) the Service Member may appeal the request to the same
O6/GS15 level or higher ISIC.  Appeal decisions should be made promptly, no 
later than than 5 days after the request is denied.

3.  Administrative Procedures.
    a.  Requesting administrative absence.  The Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS) will be used for non-covered ART requests.
        (1) Select "Admin Absence - Repro Care" in block 12a of the leave 
request.  Do not input any Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) information into NSIPS.
        (2) Administrative absence requests will be limited to the lesser of 
21 days, or the minimum number of days essential to receive the required care 
and travel needed to access the care by the most expeditious means of 
transportation practicable.
        (3) Requests for convalescent leave following receipt of non-covered 
ART must be submitted as a separate convalescent leave period and may be 
approved based on a recommendation from a Department of Defense (DoD) health 
care provider or a non-DoD health care provider from whom the Service Member 
is receiving care.
        (4) Leave approvers are responsible for ensuring the duration of the 
administrative absence is the minimum amount required to receive the required 
care and requisite travel within the limits outlined in this NAVADMIN.
    b.  Requesting funded TDY travel.  If requesting funded TDY travel, the 
request shall be submitted in Defense Travel System
(DTS) as a routine TDY.  No HIPAA information will be uploaded into DTS as 
part of substantiating documentation for funded travel.

4.  Command Tracking Requirement.  Reference (a) guidance requires Navy 
commands to track travel costs executed by all authorized travelers for non-
covered ART.  The following is required:
    a.  Reports must use the template located at
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Parenthood-
Pregnancy/Reports, which includes the required data in paragraphs 7.c.4(a) 
through paragraph 7.c.4(e) of reference (a).
    b.  Reports of usage of the cost and usage of funded travel shall be 
submitted to Navy_Parenthoodandpregnancy@us.navy.mil once the TDY period has 
concluded.

5.  The current OPNAVINST 6001.D Navy Guidelines for Parenthood and Pregnancy 
dated 12 March 2018 will be updated to reflect new guidance and policies.
