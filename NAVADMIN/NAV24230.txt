SUBJ/CNO VETERANS DAY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET// 
 
RMKS/1.  Sailors and Civilians of America's Warfighting Navy, today we honor, 
recognize, and reflect on the service and sacrifice of veterans across our 
storied 249 year history. 
 
2.  For over a century, our Nation has observed Veterans Day to honor our 
courageous service members who fought to deter aggression, defend our 
national security interests, and preserve our way of life.  We recognize and 
pay tribute to the profound impact their service has had on our Navy.  And 
today, we reflect on all of our Nation's exceptional heroes who gave their 
last full measure of devotion in defense of our Nation and all of the values 
we hold so dear. 
 
3.  We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to the long line of families and 
support networks who have enabled our service members to operate far forward, 
from seabed to space.  And we extend our thanks to the caregivers who attend 
to our veterans and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.  Our 
thoughts and prayers go out to the survivors of all those who laid down their 
life for our country. 
 
4.  To our Navy team all around the world, MCPON Honea and I could not be 
more proud to serve alongside you.  Thank you for making the decision to 
serve, thank you for supporting our veterans, and thank you for living up to 
our Nation's rich legacy of warfighting excellence every day. 
 
5.  Admiral Franchetti sends, 33rd Chief of Naval Operations.//
