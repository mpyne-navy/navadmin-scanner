CALENDAR YEAR 24 COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT CYCLE//

REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/ 012115ZAUG24// REF A IS NAVADMIN 152/24, CY24 
COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS.//

AMPN/RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN modifies requirements to paragraphs 6 and 8 of 
reference (a) regarding uploads of the Navy Comprehensive Integrated Primary 
Prevention (N-CIPP) Plan for the Calendar Year
(CY) 2024 Command Climate Assessment (CCA) cycle.

2.  In accordance with reference (a), every command that completes a CCA is 
required to create a N-CIPP plan and adhere to Immediate Superior in Command 
(ISIC) debrief requirements.  However, due to system limitations of the 
Defense Climate Portal (DCP), only Command Climate Specialists (CCS) assigned 
to echelon 2 commands will be authorized to upload N-CIPP plans to this 
portal for the CY24 cycle.

3.  Echelon 2 CCS' will be contacted directly via email by the Navy Culture 
and Force Resilience Office (OPNAV N17) to receive upload privileges in the 
DCP and specific guidance on selecting and uploading completed N-CIPP plans 
for a representative subset of up to 12 lower echelon commands.

4.  All commands will submit completed N-CIPP plans via email to 
CCA.NCIPP.fct@navy.mil by 31 January 2025, and must include their ISIC on the 
correspondence.  The N-CIPP Plan will be a single PDF file with a naming 
convention of "UIC_N-CIPP_Plan_2024" for both the filename and the subject 
line of the email.

5.  For additional information, please contact the OPNAV Integrated Primary 
Prevention program mailbox, OPNAV_IPP@navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect for the CY24 CCA cycle.
