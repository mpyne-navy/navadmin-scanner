NARR/ REF A IS BUREAU OF NAVAL PERSONNEL CAREER COUNSELOR HANDBOOK.
REF B IS NAVADMIN 303/23, EXECUTION OF THE SELECTED RESERVE PORTION OF THE 
MILITARY SERVICE OBLIGATION.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN outlines the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 retention 
environment, providing FY25 reenlistment rate benchmarks, Retention 
Excellence Award (REA), and Best in Class (BIC) criteria.
Additionally, it reemphasizes the need to retain the best talent in a 
forward-operating and talent-rich Navy team.  The changes to the REA BIC 
program focus on encouraging retention excellence through platform-specific 
retention goals and awarding one overall winner within each class in each 
Fleet.

2.  Anchoring the Future Force.  Our focus on retention must persist with 
determined purpose and urgency through FY25, ensuring we're ready to face any 
crisis or conflict now and in the future.  This mission requires us to 
recruit and retain a robust force, putting more Sailors on the field in both 
the Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC).
    a. Comprehensive Retention Strategy.  To achieve our retention goals, it 
is crucial for leaders at all levels to fully invest in this endeavor.  This 
means creating and fostering an environment where Sailors are motivated and 
committed to remaining part of the Navy family.  Leadership must innovate in 
their approaches, ensuring Sailors feel valued, supported, and engaged in 
their roles.  By actively nurturing a culture of excellence and growth, we 
can build a resilient and dedicated force ready to meet the challenges of 
tomorrow.
    b.  Importance of Reserve Affiliation (RA).  We depend on both the AC and 
RC to maintain Fleet readiness, and it remains a top priority.  To be 
accredited and calculated towards the command's reenlistment rate, RA in 
zones B and C can occur greater than 180 days from separation, however, it 
must be within the same FY.  RA in zone A is no longer factored due to the 
new military service obligation in line with reference (b).

3.  FY25 Reenlistment rate benchmarks and criteria.
    a.  FY25 legacy and BIC reenlistment benchmarks can be found on the 
MyNavyHR website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Career-
Counseling/.
    b.  Legacy Criteria.  Commands not under REA BIC category are required to 
meet or exceed the legacy benchmarks listed on the MyNavy HR website to be 
eligible for REA.  The benchmarks must be met for at least two quarters or 
the FY overall.
    c.  BIC Criteria.  The BIC distinction highlights commands who are 
optimizing principles in line with reference (a).  Command and platform types 
identified under BIC category are required to meet their specific platform 
benchmarks and remain at or below the Navy's Zone A attrition benchmark to be 
awarded the REA and are automatically considered as a BIC contender.  
Commands and platform types under BIC may not be considered for REA legacy.  
Type Commands
(TYCOM) will evaluate commands who meet their respective class REA criteria 
to determine "Best in Class".  BIC recipients can be awarded based on 
individual Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) or TYCOM determined metrics 
(e.g., COE, Command Information Program Review, Command Readiness Assessment 
Visit, Commercial Asset Visibility System, Regional Inspector General, or 
applicable administrative assessments).  Echelon 3 commands will forward the 
finalized awardees of both REA legacy and REA/BIC categories to their 
respective echelon 2 command for release of the recognition message.
    d.  An eligible command must have a designated command career counselor 
and units must have a minimum of 50 cumulative Sailors in zones A, B, and C 
who are identified using the non-average End of Active Obligated Service 
inventory.  This can be found on the "RET- ATT" report within the Navy 
retention monitoring system.  The applicable echelon 2 commander will 
determine exceptions.
    e.  Computation Exceptions.  Any zone that has no Sailors reaching 
expiration of active obligated service will have its reenlistment rate for 
that zone set to the minimum benchmark required for the zone, as long as the 
command has qualifying transactions in other zones from A through C only.  
Commands must have a minimum of one zone with qualifying transactions.
    f.  Zone A attrition percentages can be recalculated to exclude any loss 
transactions for a Sailor transferred from or to a command due to pending 
separation, medical, or legal hold.
    g.  Sailors separated due to "Other Medical" or "Disability"
will not be counted towards the attrition benchmark and commands will utilize 
reference (a) to adjust computed attrition in Zone A to be submitted to their 
ISIC or TYCOM.
    h.  Requests for an Exception to Policy (ETP) of any award element in 
paragraph 3 must be submitted in writing via the respective ISIC or TYCOM 
with specific justification.  ETP requests must be signed by the originating 
command's commanding officer.
Requests disapproved at any level will not be considered.
Disapprovals at ISIC or TYCOM level do not need to be forwarded to their 
respective echelon 2.  ETP final approval authority resides with echelon 2 
commands.
    i.  TYCOM and direct reporting counselors will evaluate and submit 
eligible commands to their respective echelon 2 commands no later than 1 
December 2025.

4.  Legacy REA and BIC Announcement Recognition.
    a.  Echelon 2 commands should announce their FY25 REA Legacy and BIC 
recipients following the consolidation of echelon 3 and direct reporting 
command submissions, no later than 31 January 2026.
    b.  Following the announcement message, REA/BIC awardees may fly the BIC 
pennant (blue, with silver anchor) and paint their anchor gold as applicable.  
Legacy REA award winners and BIC contenders who meet benchmarks and are not 
selected for BIC distinction can fly the Retention Award pennant (gold, with 
blue anchor) and paint their anchor haze grey.
