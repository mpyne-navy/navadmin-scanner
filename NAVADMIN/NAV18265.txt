AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 186/16, ELIMINATION OF THE REQUIREMENT TO DISPLAY THE 
OFFICER PHOTOGRAPH DURING SELECTION BOARDS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and reinstates the requirement 
to display the Official Photograph for all Officer Selection Boards.  This 
policy change is the result of board feedback received since the removal of 
the photograph requirement that the photographs aid the board’s ability to 
assess the Title 10 requirements of an officer’s ability to perform the 
duties of the next higher grade.

2.  This change is effective immediately.  A change to MILPERSMAN Article 
1070-020, Officer Official Military Personnel File (OMPF), will reflect the 
reinstatement of the requirement to display the photograph during all Officer 
Promotion Selection Boards.

3.  The requirement to maintain an officer photograph in the Official Service 
Record remains in accordance with MILPERSMAN Article 1070-180, Officer 
Photographs.  The point of contact for photo submission to OMPF is Records 
Management and Policy Division (PERS 313) at (901) 874-3407/DSN 882.

4.  The Statutory Selection Board POC is Officer Career Progression Branch 
(PERS 80B) via (901) 874-4533/DSN 882.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
