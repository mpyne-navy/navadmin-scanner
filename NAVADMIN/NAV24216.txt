1.  In support of reference (a), this NAVADMIN issues guidance for officers 
interested in serving as military mentors in Department of Defense (DoD) 2025 
Senate Youth Program. 
 
2.  As specified in reference (a), the DoD is soliciting nominations for up 
to 17 military officers (O-2 through O-5) to serve as ambassadors of the 
Armed Forces in support of the 63rd Annual United States Senate Youth Program 
(USSYP) Washington Week to be held in person in Washington, DC, March 1 
through 8 2025.  This unique educational experience for outstanding high 
school juniors and seniors interested in pursuing careers in public service 
was established in 1962 by U.S. Senate Resolution 324.  DoD's participation 
in USSYP since its inception personifies one of the longest standing 
commitments of the Office of the Secretary of Defense to a national merit-
based youth program.  USSYP military mentors represent their individual 
Service components and serve as role models for the 104 USSYP student 
delegates, two from each state, the District of Columbia, and the Department 
of Defense Education Activity.  They exemplify the highest standards of 
decorum and protocol, facilitate inclusive and insightful discussion among 
the students, and assist USSYP staff with implementing the week's agenda and 
activities.  Each military mentor is assigned a group of student delegates 
for the duration of the program, presenting a unique opportunity for these 
bright and influential young Americans to gain a better understanding of 
DoD's mission, people, and interrelationship with the other branches of the 
Federal Government.  Nominees must be available for all training and program 
participation in Washington, DC, from February 27 through March 8 2025.   
Application requirements are specified at 
https://pa.sp.pentagon.mil/SenateYouthProgram/SitePages/Home.aspx.   
The internal Navy deadline to apply is November 1, 2024.  The Office of the 
Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs will subsequently 
facilitate final assessments and announce military mentor selections by mid 
-January 2025.
