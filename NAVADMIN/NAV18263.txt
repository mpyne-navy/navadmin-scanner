SUBJ/UPDATE TO NAVY GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces policy changes to in-residence graduate 
education (IRGE) programs for Unrestricted Line (URL) communities.  The Navys 
Graduate Education Program supports our National Defense Strategy by 
developing Navy leaders who understand the art and science of warfighting and 
can lead in complex strategic environments.  In-residence education programs 
provide the best opportunity to mature critical and/or strategic thinking 
skills.

2.  Beginning in fiscal year 2019, administrative boards will screen the most 
fully qualified, due course officers for top-line, key competitive IRGE and 
in-residence Joint Professional Military Education opportunities, such as 
Naval War College, Naval Postgraduate School, Fleet Scholar Education 
Program, Olmstead Scholar and other similar programs.  Tuition Assistance, 
Graduate Education Vouchers and other opportunities will remain available 
without the board selection requirement.

3.  Starting with fiscal year 2020, statutory and administrative boards shall 
adhere to revised precept language that makes clear the Navys expectation 
that we invest in developing future Navy leaders as critical/strategic 
thinkers through attendance at IRGE programs.

4.  Officers in year group 2015 and beyond will be required to graduate from 
an in-residence program prior to assuming Major Command.  Officers will be 
able to screen for Major Command before completing the in-residence 
requirement to allow maximum career flexibility.  For the purpose of this 
policy, IRGE is defined as a completion of a graduate degree or professional 
military education program allowing officers to dedicate time in an academic
environment.   The program may be funded through the Navy or self-
funded.  Distance learning degree programs and the compressed JPME Phase II 
course at Joint Forces Staff College will not count toward this requirement.

5.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
