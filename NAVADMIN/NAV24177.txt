4.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 announced the 
introduction of a new application known as Electronic Submission of Selection 
Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter.
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion.
    d.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command no later than 2359 
(Central Standard Time(CST)) 10 days prior to the convening date of the 
respective board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until 
the deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.
Selection To               Convening Date       Due Date / Time
Rear Admiral               22 OCT 24            11 OCT 24 / 2359 CST
Rear Admiral (lower half)  23 OCT 24            12 OCT 24 / 2359 CST
    e.  If unable to use ESSBD, the CSCSELBOARD@navy.mil mailbox account is 
capable of receiving encrypted correspondence in line with Department of 
Defense policy.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network 
(bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 
220/19.
    f.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.  Correspondence without such an 
acknowledgement is considered third-party correspondence and will be returned 
without being presented to the board.  Classified correspondence will not be 
accepted.

5.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center (MNCC) by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833-330-6622/DSN: 882-6622).

6.  All officers are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the 
completeness and accuracy of their official records prior to the convening 
date of the board.

7.  Merit reorder will not be authorized for the subject boards.
