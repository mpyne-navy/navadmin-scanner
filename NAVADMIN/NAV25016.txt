GENTEXT/REMARKS/

1. Pursuant to references (a) through (g), the following guidance and 
direction is provided:
   (a) All agency Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) 
offices are closed and all DEIA-related contracts terminated in accordance 
with references (a) through (d).
      (1) Concerns have been raised that some programs may have been modified 
in a way that obscures their DEIA objectives. If you are aware of a change in 
any contract description or personnel position description since 05 Nov 24, 
to obscure the connection between the contract and DEIA or similar 
ideologies, please report all facts and circumstances to DEIAtruth(at)opm.gov 
by 01 Feb 25.
      (2) There will be no adverse consequences for timely reporting of this 
information. However, failure to report this information by 01 Feb 25 may 
result in adverse consequences.
      (3) By COB 25 Jan 25, Echelon II commands shall report on items 
1.(a)(3)(a) through 1.(a)(3)(d) via email to the POCs listed in paragraph 2. 
Negative responses required. Echelon II commands shall collect inputs from 
lower echelons.
          (a) Report completion of cancellation or deletion of all DEIA 
related instructions, guidance, naval messages, training requirements and 
scheduled training, to include training directives, orders, materials, 
equity, plans, and documents, and public facing media (websites, social media 
accounts, social media posts videos, etc).
          (b) Identify any contracts related to DEIA and confirm termination.
          (c) Identify any changes to DEI program or office names, contract, 
descriptions, or personnel position descriptions that have taken place since 
05 Nov 2024.
          (d) Identify any DEI related offices, to include the number of 
civilian employees that conduct DEI work.
   (b) Remote Work. In accordance with references (e) and (f), this message 
serves as notification to all personnel of reference (e), the Presidential 
Executive Order on Return to In-Person Work. Additional guidance on the 
execution of references (e) and (f) is forthcoming.
       (1) Civilian Employees. We expect DoD will establish a 30-day target 
date for teleworkers and remote workers. In accordance with Section III, 
Paragraph 1 of reference (f), eligible employees must work full-time at their 
respective duty stations unless excused due to a disability, qualifying 
medical condition, or other compelling reasons as certified by the agency 
head and the employee's supervisor. Commanders and senior leaders should 
encourage their employees to use this time to consider changes they may be 
required to make to personal and family schedules, and travel, in order to 
fully comply with an established return to office date.
       (2) Military Personnel. Commanders will direct military personnel 
return to in-person work as soon as practicable.
   (c) In accordance with reference (g), social media posts from official 
accounts at all levels of the Navy are temporarily suspended for 10 days 
effective 25 Jan 25, with the following exceptions:
        (1) Social media communication concerning the Department of Defense's 
current operations defending our southern border. This is a top priority for 
the Department of Defense.
        (2) The DoD recognizes the duty and responsibilities of military 
installation commanders to inform Service members, military families, 
veterans, base partners, and visitors about base activities and services. 
Nothing in this NAVADMIN or reference (g) should be interpreted as disrupting 
or ceasing normal installation base operations and activities. The suspension 
does not apply to normal installation base operations and activities 
including customer-focused content such as:
           (i) Base conditions, activities, and services
           (ii) DoD Education Activity school activities, operations, and 
notifications
           (iii) Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Commissary operations 
and activities
           (iv) Recruiting related activities
