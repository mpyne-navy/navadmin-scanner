RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
Spring 2025 (Cycle 116) Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) E5 through E7 candidates, to include those serving on 
voluntary recall, mobilization, or as canvasser Recruiters. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of data used to determine Cycle 116 
eligibility.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize all 
EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  EAW 
discrepancies should be addressed via the Post-examination Administration 
Comment (PAC) process after Cycle 116 worksheets are locked. 
 
3.  Cycle 116 Timeline: 
    a.  31 December 2024:  Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline.

deadline.

waived by one year with Commanding Officer (CO)/Officer-In-Charge (OIC) 
approval.  An EAW must be created manually for all who receive EP waiver.  EP 
candidates are still bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR 
candidates. 
    d.  High Year Tenure (HYT) and HYT Plus.  In line with references (f) and 
(g), HYT plus remains available.  In the EAW, the "HYT Exceeded" entry may 
reflect "Yes" - when applicable, select "Yes" for "HYT Waived." 
    e.  Candidates with an approved request for voluntary transfer to retire 
or Fleet reserve prior to mandated HYT are not eligible to advance.
