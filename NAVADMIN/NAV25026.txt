RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal of the Surface Warfare Officer 
(SWO) Senior Officer Retention Bonus (SORB) for eligible SWOs.

2.  The SWO SORB is authorized under section 332, Title 37, U.S.
Code.  In line with reference (a), the SWO SORB is effective through
29 November 2027 unless otherwise rescinded or superseded.  All applications 
for the bonus contained within this program will be submitted to the Navy 
Personnel Command, Surface Warfare Assignments, (PERS-41) for approval, 
payment processing, and tracking.

3.  This message summarizes the provisions of the SWO SORB.  All information 
provided herein is applicable to both Active Component
(AC) SWOs and Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) SWOs, except 
where otherwise noted.  The following general summary is
provided:
    a.  SWOs promoted to Commander (CDR) and who have been administratively 
screened for or have completed a SWO CDR milestone tour are eligible for the 
SWO SORB program.  The Navy will pay qualified officers for 4 years of 
obligated service from the completion of the 19th Year of Commissioned 
Service (YCS) to the completion of the 23rd YCS.  CDRs with at least 18 YCS, 
but not more than 19, are eligible for the SWO SORB.  AC SWOs will receive 
$12K on their 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd YCS anniversaries.  In line with 
references (b) and (c), TAR SWOs will also receive $12K on their 19th, 20th, 
21st and 22nd YCS anniversaries.
    b.  References (b) and (c) limit career retention bonus amounts.
While officers may receive multiple retention bonuses under section 332, 
Title 37, U.S. Code, over a career, total bonus payments under this authority 
may not exceed $300K for AC officers and $150K for TAR officers.

4.  Program Eligibility
    a.  Must meet all four of the following requirements:
        (1) Qualified and serving as an Active Duty SWO (designator
1110 or 1117).
        (2) Permanently appointed CDR.
        (3) Have at least 18 YCS, but no more than 19 YCS.
        (4) Administratively screened and serving in or have completed a CDR 
milestone tour as assigned by PERS-41.
    b.  If assigned to an at-sea tour by PERS-41, eligible officers must be 
sea duty assignable as defined by reference (d).
Additionally:
        (1) An officer under contract assigned to an at-sea tour and 
evaluated as no longer fit for sea duty by an appropriate medical authority, 
following a period of Temporary Limited Duty (TLD), will have a stop payment 
placed on their account and receive no further SWO SORB payments.  However, 
an officer on TLD who is reasonably expected by the assigned medical officer 
to make a full recovery and be found fit for sea duty will continue to 
receive scheduled payments.  This determination will be completed by PERS-41 
in line with the appropriate medical authority findings.
        (2) An officer found unfit for continued Naval Service by an 
appropriate medical authority will have a stop payment placed on their 
account and receive no further SWO SORB payments.
        (3) Should a previously ineligible officer later become fit for sea 
duty, payments will resume at normal intervals for the remainder of the 
anniversary payment(s).  Retroactive pay is not authorized for any bonus 
payments that were scheduled during the period the officer was ineligible.
    c.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An officer participating in CIP 
will be ineligible to receive SORB payments during their time in the program.  
Payments will resume upon return to service and in line with the payment 
scheme.
    d.  Bonuses will be paid in line with the payment structure in paragraph 
6.

5.  Program Execution
    a.  The SWO community manager is assigned as the program manager and is 
delegated the authority to administer the SWO SORB program according to 
applicable laws, Department of Defense directives/instructions and this 
NAVADMIN.
    b.  PERS-41 receives applications submitted in the format referenced in 
paragraph 7.  PERS-41 is delegated the authority to:
        (1) Evaluate eligibility of SWOs applying for the SWO SORB program.
        (2) Approve SWO contracts to remain on Active Duty for the stated 
period in exchange for a SWO SORB.
        (3) Administer SORB payments.
    c.  All applications require written endorsement from their commander, 
Commanding Officer (CO), or equivalent superior in charge.
    d.  Officers under a SORB agreement are not eligible to apply for the 
Permanent Military Professor (PMP) program or any redesignation programs that 
result in a designator change to any designator other than 1110 or 1117.  An 
officer under a SORB agreement may submit an application for PMP or any 
redesignation program once the date of application is within 12 months of the 
final day of bonus obligation.

6.  SORB Payment Structure.  Applications for SORB must be submitted between 
the 18th and 19th YCS.  SWO AC and TAR officers approved for the program will 
receive payments of $12K on each anniversary of their 19th, 20th, 21st and 
22nd YCS.

7.  Application Process
    a.  General Notes:
        (1) Application format can be found on the PERS-41 page of the MyNavy 
HR at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-

    b. Officers must submit a copy of the signed original contract and CO's 
endorsement by email to their applicable assignment officer and/or civilian 
assistant.

8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed by section 
373, Title 10, U.S. Code and reference (e).  A Service Member of the 
uniformed services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the member fulfills the conditions of the written agreement.  If the 
member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the written 
agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated, and the Service Member 
may be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of the pay.  
SWO SORB payments will be stopped for officers who become ineligible for this 
incentive or fail to complete the full period of additional obligated 
service.
    a.  For officers who die while serving under a SWO SORB service 
agreement, the remaining SWO SORB balance will be paid as a lump sum as part 
of the settlement of the final military pay account of the officer.  If death 
is determined to be the result of the misconduct of the member, future 
payments will be stopped and unearned portions of the bonus will be recouped, 
as applicable, in line with procedures established for members whose 
inability to complete a contracted period of service is voluntary or the 
result of misconduct.
    b.  Recoupment exception to policy determinations will be made by 
Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy Division (OPNAV N13).

9.  Additional guidance, information, and updates regarding the SWO SORB are
