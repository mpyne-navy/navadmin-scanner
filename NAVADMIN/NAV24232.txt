RMKS/1. The Surface Navy Association (SNA) will hold its 37th Annual National 
Symposium in Arlington, VA, at the Hyatt Regency, Crystal City from 14 
through 16 January 2025. This year's theme is "SURFACE WARFARE: SHARPEN THE 
SWORD." 
 
2. The SNA Annual National Symposium provides an opportunity for discussions 
on a broad range of professional and career issues. This is a forum where 
personnel can discuss innovative solutions to current and future Surface 
Warfare challenges. 
 
3. Reference (a) designates the SNA national symposium as a Tier 2 level non-
DOD hosted conference, granting a designated agent approval authority if the 
conference cost does not exceed $500,000, per reference (b). SNA 2025 meets 
this threshold. Reference (c) approves Department of the Navy attendance at 
this conference. 
      a. All Navy participation in SNA 2025 shall be consistent with 
references (d) through (f).

         (2) Awards Recognition Lunch (Invitation only) 
         (3) CEO/Flag Officer Luncheon (Invitation only) 
             - If invited to one of these events, attendees should consult 
with their command ethics counselor for assistance in determining whether 
attendance is permissible. 
         (4) Annual Banquet and Hall of Fame Induction 
            (a) Open to all active-duty service personnel and government 
civilians. To ensure an accurate meal count, active duty and government 
civilians are asked to register and pay a $20 fee online at 
https://www.surfacewarfare.org/. 
            (b) OPNAV N9 Legal Counsel determined that attendance 
and acceptance of the Annual Banquet by all military personnel and Navy 
Government Civilians is authorized by the Standards of Conduct. 
 
4. Registration information is available on the SNA website at 
https://www.surfacewarfare.org/. There is no charge to attend the SNA Seminar 
Sessions for Active Duty in Uniform and Government Civilians. All others are 
charged in accordance with respective status as determined when registering. 
 
5. TAD Travel. The estimated cost allocations for Temporary Additional Duty 
(TAD) travel are provided below. Reference (c) limits TAD attendance to 302 
individuals and attendance is controlled by OPNAV N96. Commands below are 
provided designated TAD quotas and must ensure both attendee and cost 
thresholds are not exceeded without prior approval from OPNAV N96. Additional 
TAD funds will not be provided. There is no Line of Accounting associated 
with this conference. All attendees should arrange for TAD funds 
through  parent commands.

url.  
This step is to ensure accurate numbers associated with the table 
above.  CNSP and CNSL CAG Offices will collate Fleet attendance, and 
promulgate an approved list.  Once members have registered through this site, 
an approval email, will be received and members will be permitted to arrange 
DTS travel.  POCs are SURFPAC CAG at CNSP_CAG@us.navy.mil and SURFLANT CAG at 
CNSL_NRFK_CAG@navy.mil.  This step does not register a member for the event; 
this is approval to expend TAD funds via DTS.  Symposium attendees must still 
also register at https://www.surfacewarfare.org. 
      b. OPNAV N96 will manage overall participation to ensure attendee and 
cost thresholds are not exceeded without prior approval. POCs are LCDR Tyson 
Eberhardt at tyson.s.eberhardt.mil@us.navy.mil - (703)697-6677 or Mr. Bernie 
Carter at evon.b.carter.ctr@us.navy.mil - (571)256-7911. 
 
6. Attendees, travel-authorizing officials, and certifying officers are 
directed to follow the guidance in references (a) through (f) when 
authorizing travel and are responsible for protecting taxpayer funds from 
fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.  Attendees must be good stewards of 
taxpayer dollars in attending this event and are required to file tax 
extension forms to reduce lodging costs if applicable. Meals and lodging are 
reimbursed to attendees in a TAD status only at the authorized per diem rate. 
If the conference host provides meals, attendees must annotate travel 
vouchers accordingly. Local attendees who are able to attend at no cost to 
the government are authorized to file Local Defense Travel System claims. 
High quality government/military lodging options such as NGIS, Navy Lodges, 
and transient lodging facilities are available at

most cost-efficient means of transportation, and specifically approved and 
documented by the TAD authorizing official.
