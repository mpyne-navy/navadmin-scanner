SUBJ/2024 PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE DAY//

RMKS/1.  In 1941 on an early Sunday morning, the Imperial Japanese Navy 
launched their aircraft off the coast of Hawaii and targeted the United 
States Pacific Fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor.  In just 90 minutes, the 
surprise attack on our unsuspecting forces destroyed and damaged 19 warships, 
300 aircraft, and took the lives of over 2,400 Americans.  As President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt famously described, December 7th, 1941 will forever be 
"a date which will live in infamy."

2.  While the surprise attack on our Pacific Forces spurred shock and anger 
within all Americans, it also emboldened our fighting forces and united our 
Nation as we entered World War II.  Despite our losses and in the face of 
adversity, our Navy regrouped, steamed into formation, and sailed forward to 
victory, winning decisively across the Pacific theater over the next several 
years.

3.  On this Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we pay our respect to all of the 
brave servicemembers and Department of Defense civilians who sprang into 
action with extraordinary courage and at great peril to their own lives.  
Faced with unimaginable odds, they fought valiantly to defend their ships and 
to save the lives of their shipmates.  And although countless acts of valor 
went unrecorded that day, fifteen Navy Sailors, from seaman to admiral, were 
awarded the Medal of Honor.

4.  The brave actions of our Nation's best on that fateful day stand eternal 
as part of our Navy's rich 249 year history.  As we reflect on their service 
and sacrifice, let us each do our part to ensure that America's Warfighting 
Navy continues to build on their legacy, forever linked to those Shipmates 
through our Navy core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment.

5.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, 33rd Chief of Naval Operations and 
MCPON J. M. Honea, 16th Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
