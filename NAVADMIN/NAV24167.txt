SUBJ/TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR NAVY CIVILIAN 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATION PROFESSIONALS// 
 
POC/CHINFO POLICY, REQUIREMENTS, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORATE/ 
LOC:WASHINGTON DC/ 
COMM: 703-571-6408/EMAIL: CHINFO-OI_08(at)us.navy.mil// 
 
RMKS/1.  The purpose of this message is to provide Navy civilian 
communicators, as well as their leaders at the local command level, a curated 
list of training and professional development opportunities valued.  These 
opportunities are designed to cultivate versatile and proficient employees 
who are equipped to lead effective communication across all echelons of 
command throughout their careers.  This list is not exhaustive; leaders are 
encouraged to explore all available options when approving training for their 
communication teams. 
 
2.  To stay competitive with the civilian sector and remain an employer of 
choice, there is a pressing need to attract new talent.  For modern job 
seekers, one of the most valued benefits of employment is the opportunity for 
professional growth, both through practical experience and formal 
education.  Our workforce will remain the most respected communicators in the 
world when they are armed with the latest communication and leadership 
training and education. 
 
3.  While it is incumbent on leaders to recognize the importance and value of 
training, it is even more important for Navy civilian employees to consider 
their career goals and where there are gaps in their knowledge.  They must 
work with their supervisors to build effective individual development plans 
to achieve specific professional development goals.  Many commands will 
require this as a condition for subsidizing training. 
 
4.  The following training and professional development opportunities, 
compiled by the Navy Office of Information (CHINFO), merit strong 
consideration for the career development of Navy civilian public affairs 
professionals.  They are provided as a means to build a cadre of talented 
civilian communicators who tell truth with a purpose, combat foreign malign 
influence, and compete and win in the contested 21st Century information 
environment.

        (15) DINFOS has partnered with the University of West Virginia's 
College of Creative Arts and Media enabling DINFOS alumni to transfer select 
credits earned in military training into WVU's Bachelor of Science in 
Integrated Marketing Communications program. A similar opportunity exists for 
those seeking a Master's Degree.  Both programs offer online courses, credit 
for military experience and prior learning, flexible time commitments and 
significantly reduced tuition. Find out more by reaching out to CHINFO OI-1. 
    b.  Civilian Institution Academic Opportunities. 
        (1) There are a number of civilian universities that offer online 
graduate programs which may be more attractive to civilian communicators as 
they afford the learner a cost-wise opportunity to balance education with 
work. 
        (2) Most universities also offer Graduate Certificate Programs.  More 
narrowly-focused than the course of study for a master's degree, earning a 
graduate certificate enables learners to focus more tightly on the academic 
discipline in which they are interested or to refresh skills more relevant to 
modern communication.  Requiring only three to six graduate-level courses, 
they can be completed much sooner than a master's, and they can frequently be 
completed online or via distance learning.  If you later decide you would 
like to complete the requirements for a master's degree, you may be able to 
apply your certificate coursework toward a graduate degree.  Another 
consideration is the opportunity to gain academic understanding and knowledge 
in a field related to military public affairs such as leadership, 
international relations, etc.  Since the cost is so much lower than a full 
master's degree this may also be a more manageable option for your command's 
budget. 
    c.  Credentialing and Certification 
        (1) The Department of Defense Civilian COOL (Credentialing 
Opportunities On-Line) program is a centralized resource designed to assist 
civilian employees in identifying relevant certification and licensure 
opportunities aligned with their roles.  Rather than duplicating  
https://www.cool.osd.mil/, this message reaffirms the U.S. Navy's endorsement 
of the communication related credentials and licenses listed under the 
General Arts and Information Series at this link: 
https://www.cool.osd.mil/dciv/moc/index.html?moc=civ_1001&tab=overview 
        (2) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, 
Public Law 107-107, Section 1112, Chapter 23 of Title 5, United States Code, 
577, permits agencies to pay expenses for employees to obtain and renew 
professional credentials, including expenses for professional accreditation, 
State-imposed and professional licenses, and professional certifications, and 
examinations to obtain such credentials.   
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-107publ107/pdf/PLAW-107publ107.pdf 
        (3) DOD's implementing policy provides components discretion in 
paying for professional credentials and related expenses and creates a 
recruitment and retention incentive.  See the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense Memorandum dated June 17, 2002 for more information:  
https://www.cool.osd.mil/dciv/costs_and_funding/index.html?LocalOrganizationF
unding 
    d.  Professional Development Opportunities 
        (1)  A number of public relations and public affairs associations 
offer training and certifications that are valued by the Navy public affairs 
community because they give students insight into how the civilian public 
relations community operates.  There are also many opportunities for training 
and education in specialized categories of communication. Radiological 
emergency management is a good example and would be valued in regions with 
nuclear-powered ships, or the shipyards where such ships are built and 
maintained, as contingency response plans frequently require assistance from 
organizations across those waterfronts.  Diversifying the education and 
skills of our people strengthens the entire community. 
 
6.  Military/National Security/Policy Education 
    a.  Naval War College Programs 
        (1) NWC 10-Month Resident Program.  Every academic year, selected

https://cisa.ndu.edu/Academics/Certificate-Programs/ 
    d.  Legislative and Other Programs 
        (1) Navy Capitol Hill Workshop (The Government Affairs Institute at 
Georgetown University).  The Department of the Navy-sponsored Navy Capitol 
Hill Workshop provides employees GS-11 and above a first-hand understanding

Congress, congressional staff, academic observers, interest group 
representatives, news media representatives, and executive branch officials, 
including Navy Office of Legislative Affairs staff.  Each four-day workshop 
is conducted entirely on Capitol Hill.   
https://gai.georgetown.edu/?p=451 
        (2) The Navy Legislative Fellows program provides an opportunity for 
senior civilian employees to broaden their experience and knowledge in the 
operations and organization of Congress while enhancing the Navy's ability to 
fulfill its role in the national policy development process. The fellowship 
consists of a year-long full-time assignment to the office of a U.S.

8.  Finally, a couple of notes for civilian PA professionals and their 
leaders. 
    a.  The new personnel management system Waypoints which has already been 
deployed across the systems commands has a number of professional development 
tools including the use of some LinkedIn Learning training.  The system also 
features a competency assessment which feeds into the development of 
individual development plans, which are used to guide decisions about command 
support for training requests from employees. 
    b.  Also, in addition to the above training opportunities, DOD sponsors a 
number of free photo/video workshops/shoot-offs that are open to 
civilians.  These represent amazing opportunities to work with and learn from 
colleagues, many of whom possess world class skills in the visual arts, a key 
component of modern story telling. 
    c.  Leaders are encouraged to work with their human resources teams to 
identify backfill options such as reserve support or term hires, to fill a 
gap for someone on extended TAD orders for training. 
    d.  Lastly, leaders should consider ensuring specific training 
requirements are listed in individual position descriptions.  This can help 
make the case for the requirement for training in austere times. 
 
9.  Team First.
