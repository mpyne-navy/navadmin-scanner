RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES AN FY-12 QUOTA-BASED ENLISTED RETENTION BOARD 
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF REF A.  UNPRECEDENTED RETENTION AND REDUCED ATTRITION 
RATES ACROSS THE NAVY HAVE RESULTED IN A REQUIREMENT TO REBALANCE THE FORCE.  
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOARD IS TO REDUCE OVERMANNING IN RATINGS PROJECTED TO BE 
OVER 103% MANNED IN FY-12.  REBALANCING OUR MANNING WILL IMPROVE ADVANCEMENT 
RATES AND INCREASE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGH PERFORMING SAILORS TO RECEIVE IN-RATE 
REENLISTMENT QUOTAS BY REDUCING THE STRAIN ON PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS).  WHILE 
PTS IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ENSURE WE RETAIN OUR BEST PERFORMING SAILORS, 
BALANCING SENIORITY, SKILLS, AND EXPERIENCE, ITS SCOPE IS LIMITED TO ONLY 
THOSE AT A REENLISTMENT DECISION POINT.
THIS BOARD IS A TARGETED ACTION AIMED AT ONLY THE MOST OVERMANNED RATINGS AND 
WILL EXAMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUGHLY 16,000 SAILORS.
APPROXIMATELY 3,000 SAILORS WILL NOT BE RETAINED ON ACTIVE DUTY, BUT WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED TO APPLY FOR POSITIONS IN THE SELECTED RESERVE (SEE PARA 8A).  
SAILORS ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO REQUEST CONVERSION INTO AN UNDERMANNED RATING 
PRIOR TO THE BOARD (SEE PARA 5); THOSE APPROVED FOR CONVERSION WILL BE EXEMPT 
FROM THIS BOARD.

2.  THE PRIMARY CRITERIA FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIS QUOTA-BASED BOARD IS 
SUSTAINED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE, WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO BALANCE THE FORCE IN 
TERMS OF SENIORITY, EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS TO MEET FLEET AND JOINT 
REQUIREMENTS.  THE BOARD WILL EXAMINE THE RECORDS OF ALL ELIGIBLE SAILORS FOR 
DECLINING PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS RECENT DOCUMENTED MISCONDUCT AND SUBSTANDARD 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.  THESE WILL BE KEY FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER 
RETENTION IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE NAVY.  THE BOARD WILL RETAIN THE 
MOST FULLY QUALIFIED SAILORS WITH POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER SERVICE.  THE BOARD 
WILL CONSIDER THE FACTORS LISTED BELOW IN RETENTION DETERMINATIONS.  THIS LIST 
IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE, BUT PROVIDES BASIC PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR 
CONSIDERATION:
      (1) SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE OF DUTY;
      (2) DECLINING PERFORMANCE;
      (3) DETACHMENT FOR CAUSE PER REF B;
      (4) REMOVAL OF SECURITY CLEARANCE WHEN REQUIRED BY RATING
      ;
      (5) MILITARY OR CIVILIAN CONVICTION OR NJP;
      (6) ADMINISTRATIVE OR PERSONNEL ACTION FOR MISCONDUCT
      SUCH AS
DUI, DWI, SPOUSE OR CHILD ABUSE.
IN ADDITION TO THESE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, MAXIMUM RETENTION QUOTAS WILL BE 
DEVELOPED BY RATING, PAYGRADE, AND YEARS OF SERVICE.  BOARD MEMBERS WILL USE 
THEIR JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THE MOST FULLY QUALIFIED SAILORS, WITH POTENTIAL 
FOR FURTHER NAVAL SERVICE, APPLYING BOTH PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND THE QUOTAS 
ASSIGNED.  INITIAL QUOTAS WILL BE AVAILABLE 16 MAY 2011 FOR REVIEW BY SERVICE 
MEMBERS ON THE NPC ENLISTED CONTINUATION BOARD PAGE, 
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/BOARDS/ENLISTEDCONTINUATION/
PAGES/DEFAULT.ASPX, AND WILL BE UPDATED JUST PRIOR TO THE BOARD TO REFLECT 
CURRENT MANNING BY RATING.
