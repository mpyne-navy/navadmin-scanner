Board, submit packages via encrypted e-mail to cselboard@us.navy.mil no later 
than 15 October 2024.  Do not use the electronic submission of selection

the attached single-pdf package.  Additionally, the full name of the 
candidate and full social security number (SSN) (full SSN marked on top right 
of each page) must be on all pages of the package.  The package requirements 
contained in reference (b), are modified as follows, and will only include:
