(RKEs) for Active Duty and Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR)

(EAW) is the authoritative source of data used to determine Cycle 267 E5 and 
E6 eligibility.
    a.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize all EAWs 
in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).
    b.  For some Sailors in BBA ratings, Educational Services Officers (ESOs) 
may be required to wait until the effective advancement date for the 
applicable paygrade to be updated before an EAW can be created manually.
    c.  EAW discrepancies may be addressed via the Post-exam Administration 
Comment (PAC) process after worksheets are locked for the cycle.

3.  Cycle 267 timeline:
    a.  31 January 2025:  Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam

commands that require rescheduling of NWAE or RKE administration date(s) 
(with valid reason) may request this deviation from Navy Personnel Command

2025.

4.  Eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (b).  The 
following information is specific to Cycle 267:
    a.  Terminal Eligibility Date (TED):  1 July 2025.
    b.  In line with reference (a), there is no minimum Time-in-Rate
(TIR) requirement for Sailors in the Active Duty BBA ratings.
However, E4 and E5 Sailors are required to have an in-grade Commanding 
Officer (CO) or Officer in Charge (OIC) recommendation for advancement 
periodic evaluation to participate in an RKE.

Sailors:
        (1)  E6 - 1 July 2022

all who receive that waiver.  EP candidates are still bound by the same PMK-
EE deadline as regular TIR candidates.
    d.  In line with reference (d), PMK-EE remains mandatory once per 
paygrade for all E5 and E6 candidates to be eligible for exam cycle 
participation.  Refer to reference (e) regarding special exceptions for E4 
new accessions, including EP candidates.  Waivers are normally not approved 
without extraordinary circumstances.

cycle participation; however, ELD course completion is not mandatory for E-5

the HYT Plus Pilot program allows for Sailors to continue their Navy careers 
beyond the HYT limits.  References (g) and (h) should be read in their 
entirety.  In the EAW, the "HYT Exceeded"

adjudication.
