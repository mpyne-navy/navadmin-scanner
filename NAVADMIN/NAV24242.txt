RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to references (a) through 
(d) for the Calendar Year 2025 (CY2025) Physical Fitness Assessment 
(PFA) cycle (1 February 2025 to 30 November 2025) for a Body 
Composition Assessment (BCA) and Age-Adjusted Standards (AAS) 
exemption for exceptional Physical Readiness Test (PRT) performance. 
 
2.  Navy's Culture of Excellence 2.0 requires critical re-evaluation 
of our policies and procedures to build Great People, Great Leaders, 
and Great Teams while developing Sailors in mind, body, and spirit. 
We are modernizing our BCA by recognizing that our current policies 
and procedures can be improved to better assess every single Sailor 
to determine a Sailor's overall physical readiness. 
 
3.  BCA and AAS PRT Exemption.  Effective for the CY2025 PFA cycle: 
    a.  Sailors who do not meet official Navy BCA (Step-3) standards 
and score EXCELLENT-LOW or above on their official PRT will receive 
an overall PFA PASS and be exempt from participation in the Fitness 
Enhancement Program (FEP). 
    b.  Sailors who do not meet AAS and score EXCELLENT-LOW or above 
on their official PRT will be exempt from participation in the FEP. 
For more information on AAS, refer to reference (c). 
    c.  The purpose of this exemption is to recognize that some 
Sailors who do not meet the BCA standard are still able to maintain 
operational readiness.  This policy exemption also aligns with 
Department of Defense policy in reference (e). 
    d.  A Sailor must participate in all three modalities (pushups, 
forearm plank, and run or alternate cardio, if authorized) of the 
PRT to be eligible for this exemption. 
    e.  A Sailor who meets exemption requirements must complete one 
of the nutrition education options below per reference (d).  These 
nutrition education options are the same options that FEP enrollees 
are required to complete. 
        (1) Nutrition Consult for Individual Visit or Class with 
Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).  This option allows for the 
participant to meet, a minimum of one visit, individually (e.g., 
one-on-one) with a RDN or attend an appropriate nutrition class. 
Classes are typically offered at the MTF or at a local Health 
Promotion and Wellness Center. 
        (2) ShipShape Program.  This six-module evidence-based 
program is the official Navy weight management program designed to 
assist members with making positive behavior changes to promote 
healthy weight loss.  Participants selecting this nutrition 
education option are encouraged to self-refer to the program by 
contacting their local Medical Treatment Facility or Health 
promotion and Wellness Center 
        (3) Nutrition Self-Study Course.  This course is available 
on the Official Navy PFA App.  Participants will learn about 
nutrition basics, making healthier food choices, portion control, 
and behavior modifications necessary for healthy weight management. 
        (4) Mission Nutrition Course.  This is a standardized, 
science-based two-day course focused on improving individual 
nutritional knowledge and awareness.  The course is available at 
Navy Fitness centers that have a certified instructor.  More 
information is available at 
https://www.navyfitness.org/fitness/nutrition/mission-nutrition. 
        (5) Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS). 
The Fueling Series and the Virtual Meal Builder provides Sailors 
with the tools that support healthy nutrition choices and the 
creation of individualized meal plans in both shore-based and 
operational environments.  The Command Fitness Leader 
(CFL)/Assistant CFL must review the NOFFS-nutrition section provided 
on https://www.navyfitness.org/fitness/nutrition/noffsfueling-series  
or within the NOFFS app with the member for this nutrition option. 
    f.  The CFL is responsible for managing a Sailor's nutrition 
enrollment in the Physical Readiness Information Management System 
(PRIMS-2).  Upon selecting a nutrition education option, Sailors 
must inform their CFL of which option they choose and provide proof 
of completion or progression within 30 days of nutrition enrollment. 
The completed education option is only valid for one PFA cycle. 
    g.  The exceptional PRT exemption score criteria will be re- 
evaluated after the CY2025 PFA cycle. 
    h.  References (b) and (d) will be updated to reflect this 
policy change and provide implementation guidance prior to the 
CY2025 PFA cycle. 
 
4.  The point of contact for questions is MyNavy Career Center at 
(833) 330-MNCC or askmncc.fct@navy.mil. 
 
5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
