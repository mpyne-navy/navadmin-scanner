3.  All commands are tasked to "deter" potential insider threats by 
instituting appropriate security countermeasures, including awareness and 
education programs; "detect" individuals at risk of becoming insider threats 
by identifying potential risk indicators; and "mitigate" malicious activity 
as it arises through a proactive approach leveraging available resources and 
expertise. 
 
4.  Most insider threats develop over time with indicators of concerning 
activity prior to malicious events occurring.  Possible actions and risk 
indicators may include, but are not limited to: 
    - Generally disregarding security procedures. 
    - Seeking access to information outside of need-to-know access. 
    - Attempting to access sensitive areas, such as where classified 
information is stored, discussed, or processed. 
    - Working inconsistent hours, such as staying late or arriving early. 
    - Insisting on unauthorized access or working in private. 
    - Displaying workplace violence, such as physical aggression, verbal 
abuse, harassment, and intimidation. 
 
5.  Early intervention through reporting is crucial.  If you see something, 
you must say something and then do something to enable positive intervention 
and/or de-escalation before a malicious or harmful act occurs.  Report 
concerning actions to your chain of command and to the Navy Insider Threat 
Hub at (703) 695-7700, insiderthreat.fct@navy.mil, 
or https://www.secnav.navy.mil/ITP/Pages/default.aspx.  Reporting can be 
anonymous. 
 
6.  The Navy Insider Threat Hub provides highly trained, multidisciplinary 
insider threat analysts to assess the potential risk an insider may pose to 
Navy personnel, resources, facilities, or information.  The goal is to 
prevent or mitigate risks and restore the Sailor, civilian, or contractor 
back to a trusted status. 
 
7.  All DON military, civilian, and contractor personnel must complete the 
annual Counterintelligence and Insider Threat Awareness and Reporting 
Training (DON-CIAR-1.0-NCIS) in the Total Workforce Management System (TWMS) 
at https://twms.dc3n.navy.mil/login.asp.  The training discusses insider 
threats and how individuals can respond to potential malicious 
activity.  Training must be completed within 30 days of initial employment, 
entry-on-duty, or following information system access and annually 
thereafter.  For FY 2024, training should be completed no later than 30 
September 2024.  Report completion to the command insider threat 
representative.  Counter-insider threat educational and training resources 
are at https://www.cdse.edu/Training/Security-Posters/Insider-Threat/ and can 
be posted in common areas. 
 
8.  Additional insider threat education and awareness resources include: 
    - The Secretary of the Navy Insider Threat Program: 
https://www.secnav.navy.mil/itp/Pages/default.aspx 
    - Navy Insider Threat Program events and awareness materials: 
https://flankspeed.sharepoint-mil.us.mcas-gov.us/sites/NIA/SitePages/US-Navy-
Insider-Threat-Program.aspx

awareness videos and posters: https://www.dvidshub.net/unit/DUSN-IS. 
    - Center for Development of Security Excellence education and awareness 
materials and training tools: https://www.cdse.edu/Training/Toolkits/Insider-
Threat-Toolkit/. 
    - Outreach and Engagement:  The Navy Insider Threat Team offers in-person 
and virtual outreach training for all personnel (military, civilian and 
contractor) on the importance of recognizing insider threat potential risk 
indicators, reporting requirements, and how to engage with the Navy Insider 
Threat Program. 
 
9.  The Navy Insider Threat Program has a list of potential insider threat 
risk indicators reporting criteria to help identify concerning behaviors and 
appropriate actions to take.  The Navy will continue to support national, 
Department of Defense, DON, and Navy command efforts to counter insider 
threats.  Keeping the workforce safe and protecting our nation's sensitive 
and classified information to ensure successful mission accomplishment is 
priority one and requires everyone's vigilance and timely reporting of any 
observed suspicious activity or potentially threatening behaviors.  This 
mindset is essential to enable our nation to counter the threat from within. 
 
10.  The risk of insider threat activity is increasing as malignant 
individuals and adversarial governments seek new ways to exploit 
vulnerabilities within our organization and people.  Every member of the U.S. 
Navy must remain vigilant to the risk indicators associated with insider 
threat behaviors and actions, and must intervene or report when they see or 
hear potentially malicious act.
