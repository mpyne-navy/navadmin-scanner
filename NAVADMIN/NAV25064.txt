SUBJ/CHIEF PETTY OFFICER BIRTHDAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  On 1 April 2025, we honor 132 years of the Chief Petty Officer rank.  
We pay tribute to the profound legacy and enduring spirit of the Chiefs who 
shaped our Navy into the lethal fighting force it is today.

2.  The role of a Chief Petty Officer is more than just a rank; it is the 
embodiment of leadership, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to duty.  
Chiefs are the backbone of our Navy, guiding and inspiring both junior 
Sailors and senior officers alike.  Their knowledge, experience, and 
dedication ensure that our Sailors are prepared to move fast and think 
outside the box.  Wearing anchors signifies not only authority but also the 
responsibility to uphold a warrior ethos based on meritocracy, 
accountability, standards, and readiness.
Commands are encouraged to mark this occasion with fitting celebrations that 
honor the history and contributions of Chief Petty Officers.

3.  For our Chief Petty Officers, I encourage you to share stories of valor 
and dedication within your ranks, recognize those who exemplify the spirit of 
leadership, and reinforce the values that define us as American warriors.  
Assess your strengths and areas for growth as leaders and mentors.  Ask 
yourselves if you are doing everything possible to prepare your Sailors for 
battle while living up to the ideals of our core values: Honor, Courage, and 
Commitment.  As you don your anchors today, remember that you stand on the 
shoulders of giants, and it is your privilege to carry forward their legacy 
with pride and purpose.

4. Released by ADM J. W. Kilby, Acting Chief of Naval Operations and MCPON J. 
M. Honea, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
