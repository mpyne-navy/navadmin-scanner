SUBJ/IMPLEMENTATION OF NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION CODE N34Z IDENTIFYING 
SUBMARINE LEADING ENGINEERING LABORATORY TECHNICIAN QUALIFICATION//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/15NOV16//

AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1220.1F, CHANGING OR REMOVING NAVY ENLISTED 
CLASSIFICATION CODES FOR NUCLEAR PROPULSION PLANT PERSONNEL.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the removal of the Leading Engineering 
Laboratory Technician (LELT) qualification as a prerequisite for the Navy 
Enlisted Classification (NEC) code N16S and the implementation of the N34Z 
NEC code to document qualification as a submarine LELT.

2.  N34Z is a secondary NEC that is awarded after a submarine Sailor 
qualifies for LELT and will be used in conjunction with the Sailor's primary 
NEC.

3.  No action is required for Sailors who already have the N16S NEC as of 3 
March 2025.  Nuclear Enlisted Programs (OPNAV N133D) will automatically 
assign the N34Z NEC to these Sailors.

4.  For Sailors who qualify LELT after 3 March 2025, a NEC Change Request 
(NAVPERS 1221/6) must be submitted to OPNAV N133D requesting assignment of 
the N34Z NEC.  Commanding Officers must verify the effective date is the 
qualification date and annotate the effective date in block 12 of the NAVPERS 
1221/6.

5.  Submit all N34Z NEC requests to OPNAV N133D via e-mail to 
bullnuke@navy.mil.

6.  Points of contact:  For all questions and concerns, commands and Sailors 
should contact OPNAV N133D at (703)604-5491/DSN 664, (703)604-5492/DSN 664, 
or via e-mail at bullnuke@navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until reference (a) is revised.
