RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Department of Defense (DoD) mandated updates 
to improve the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) experience for 
military families and to create program consistency across the Services per 
references (a) and (b).  Navy EFMP updates will be implemented gradually, 
bringing the Navy EFMP in line with other DoD and Service EFMPs by the end of 
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25).  Continuity of benefits for new and existing 
enrollees will be maintained.  Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory for all 
Active Duty Service Members and Reservists on orders over 30 calendar days, 
who have a family member with a qualifying chronic medical (physical, 
developmental, or mental health) condition or who require special educational 
support per references (b) and (c).  The primary purpose of the EFMP is to 
ensure family member's medical and educational needs are considered during 
the assignment process. 
 
2.  EFMP updates will improve oversight and implementation as well as provide 
a single Point of Contact (POC) for EFMP needs.  The following changes will 
be fully implemented by the end of FY25: 
    a.  Single-lead EFMP Office.  The Navy established a centralized EFMP 
office at Navy Personnel Command, EFMP Manager (PERS-456) to oversee 
implementation of the EFMP and provide a single POC for the coordination of 
health care services, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) assignments, and 
educational support services. 
    b.  Transition to individualized approach for case management. 
In alignment with reference (b) and the other Services, Navy will no longer 
utilize traditional Exceptional Family Member (EFM) categories.  This 
transition will offer greater precision in aligning the needs of each EFM to 
those capabilities available at assignment locations. 
    c.  Central Screening Committee (CSC) EFMP Enrollment, Respite Care, and 
Priority Housing.  The CSC is a medical review committee consisting of 
healthcare professionals responsible for reviewing completed EFMP enrollment 
packages.  The CSC makes EFMP enrollment determinations and adjudications on 
Level of Need (LON) as LON pertains to respite care and priority placement on 
the Navy housing waitlist, as applicable. 
       (1)  The CSC transitioned from the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery 
(BUMED) Medical Readiness (BUMED N10D) to the single-lead EFMP office,  
PERS-456. 
       (2)  EFMP coordinators at the military treatment facility will 
continue to assist the CSC in the identification and enrollment of current 
and prospective EFMs, and provide EFMP training and marketing to medical 
staff personnel. 
       (3)  Per reference (c), EFMP enrolled Service Members are required to 
update their EFMP enrollment status every three years or when a change in 
special medical or educational needs occurs. 
    d.  Assignment Process.  Service Members enrolled in the EFMP will apply 
for assignments in MyNavy Assignment or coordinate with detailers as 
appropriate.  PERS-456 will confirm the required medical or special 
educational services are available at the assignment location prior to orders 
being released. 
      (1)  Assignment Reconsideration.  If a Sailor considers the assignment 
medically or educationally inappropriate, the Sailor may submit a request to 
PERS-456 for an assignment reconsideration. 
      (2)  The EFMP assignment process does not replace the operational or 
overseas suitability screening requirement. 
Suitability screening is a separate process and required for Service Members 
receiving accompanied orders to a location outside the continental United 
States and remote duty, per reference (d). 
      (3)  PERS-456 will initiate the family support warm hand-off process 
when the required care services are available at the gaining location.  As 
EFM families move from one installation to another, the losing installation 
EFMP family support office will proactively communicate with the gaining EFMP 
family support office to communicate the family's needs to help with the 
continuation of services.  The warm hand-off may include information for 
transitioning respite care, disability-related housing needs, obtaining 
educational support, or connecting to local support groups upon arrival at 
the new location. 
    e.  EFMP Respite Care.  The DoD established a standardized respite care 
benefit, including the number of hours available to military families 
enrolled in the EFMP who meet the eligibility criteria.  The respite care 
benefit provides family members with temporary relief from the responsibility 
for the regular care of the EFM, utilizing trained and background checked 
approved providers. 
The EFMP respite care age-specific LON rubrics help the Services determine 
eligibility and number of allotted hours per month, per family.  The changes 
to the Navy's Respite Care Program will be fully implemented on 1 October 
2025.  LON rubrics scoring is as follows: 
       (1)  LON 1 and LON 2:  Sailors with dependents with low needs are 
ineligible for EFMP respite care. 
       (2)  LON 3:  Sailors with dependents with moderate needs, to include 
adults, are eligible to receive 20 hours per month of EFMP respite care. 
       (3)  LON 4:  Sailors with dependents with profound needs, to include 
adults, are eligible for 32 hours per month of EFMP respite care services. 
       (4)  If previously qualified for respite care services, but the LON 
reclassification changes eligibility, respite care benefits will continue at 
the current level until 1 October 2025. 
       (5)  For PCSs occurring on or after 1 July 2025, eligibility will be 
based on LON determination.  If the LON assessment disqualifies the dependent 
for respite care, benefits expire on the date the PCS occurs.  If determined 
eligible, the Service Member must apply for respite care benefits at the new 
duty station under updated eligibility guidelines. 
        (6)  Changes to respite care hours and eligibility for current 
respite care users will not take effect until 1 October 2025, with the 
exception of a PCS move occurring on or after 1 July 2025. 
    f.  Priority Placement on Navy Housing Waitlist.  Navy Housing applicants 
with family members enrolled in EFMP deemed eligible for a priority placement 
on the Navy Housing waitlist will be afforded the priority.  Housing waitlist 
priority does not guarantee immediate housing assignment, but helps to 
quickly and adequately house those requiring permanency in living 
arrangements.  Any housing accommodation requests should be provided to 
landlord. 
    (1)  Sailors with a previous assignment letter of EFMP categories 4 and 
5, as well as enrollees designated in writing by the CSC, will be afforded 
the priority placement until 1 October 2025.  After 1 October 2025, only 
those designated in writing via the CSC will be eligible for priority housing 
placement. 
    (2)  Non-Navy applicants applying for Navy housing will need to contact 
PERS-456 to validate priority placement on the Navy Housing waitlist. 
        (a)  Provide proof of enrollment in service EFMP.  If enrollment 
letter is not available, PERS-456 will contact the respective service to 
validate. 
        (b)  Provide a copy of the DD-2792, DD-2792-1, and Individualized 
Education Program (IEP)/Individualized Family Service Plan, as applicable. 
 
3.  Legal Assistance for Special Education Concerns.  Navy Region Legal 
Service Offices (RLSO) are available to provide special education legal 
support to families enrolled in the EFMP, as appropriate.  General Legal 
Assistance Attorneys located exclusively at RLSO Mid-Atlantic in Norfolk, VA; 
RLSO Southwest in San Diego, CA; and RLSO Southeast in Jacksonville, FL 
consult with EFMP Special Education Liaisons, EFMP Case Liaisons, and School 
Liaisons on an as needed basis.  Various team members may consult with EFMP 
families on a variety of topics related to availability of schools, special 
education school meetings, due process, IEPs, housing, medical, and 
information and referral services.  Additional resources are available at:
