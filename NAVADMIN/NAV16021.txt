RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN replaces reference (a), guidance for the Information 
Technology Procurement Request (ITPR) and approval process.

2.  Information Technology Acquisition Approval Process (ITAAP) ensures 
effective and efficient expenditure of funding to acquire Information 
Technology (IT) capabilities, prevent duplicate investments, provide 
visibility on all Navy IT related expenditures, and ultimately achieve 
strategic sourcing for IT procurement.  Procurement actions for IT may not be 
initiated without an ITPR approval.  Command Contracting Officers and 
Purchasing Agents including those operating at Fleet Logistic Centers will 
not obligate government funds without an approved ITPR control number 
included with the procurement documents.

3.  Once an ITPR has been submitted, each reviewer in the workflow will have 
a total of ten business days to take action on the ITPR.  The reviewer will 
receive notification to act on the request or it will automatically cancel at 
the end of the 10th business day.  Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) 
must ensure minimum delays in the workflow process including the setting of 
proxy reviewers if the assigned reviewer is not available.

4.  All Programs of Record (POR), including Defense Business System requests 
are required to utilize the systems subject matter expert exemption Speed 
Pass.  In addition all PORs and Non PORs are encouraged to submit annual 
Spend Plan requests; an approved spend plan eliminates submitting subsequent 
requests during the fiscal year.

5.  The following IT procurement guidance for FY-16 applies to all IT assets 
including hardware, software, maintenance, contract support, 
telecommunication services, and back office IT that supports tactical 
programs reported in the Program Budget Information System-IT (PBIS-IT) and 
resourced with the Navy appropriated funds.  ITPRs shall be properly scoped 
for the required need, and shall not be segmented to avoid the IT dollar 
thresholds or IT oversight and governance.
    a.  IT assets $25,000 or less, including assets purchased via the 
Government Credit Card program are exempt from this process and do not 
require the submission of an ITPR.  All exempt requests will be reported 
quarterly.  All Echelon II commands will be required to submit an 
organization $25,000 or less quarterly report to Deputy Department of the 
Navy Chief Information Officer Navy (DDCIO (N)).  Restrictions to the $25,000 
threshold can be found in paragraph 6.  For ITPRs less than $500,000 the 
Echelon II Command Information Officer (Echelon II CIO) retains discretion to 
set a local approval threshold amount for assigned Echelon III and below 
commands.  ITPRs $500,000 or greater will route to the DDCIO (N) for 
approval.  ITPRs submitted for $20 million or greater require Chief of Naval 
Operations (N80) staff review. N80 will in coordination with DDCIO (N) 
recommend final approval or disapproval.  If further review is required, N80 
will present the request to the Resources Requirement Review Board (R3B) for 
a final procurement decision.
    b.  Procurement requests must be submitted electronically via Navy 
Information Dominance Approval System (NAV IDAS) for:
        (1) Business mission area programs certified and approved by the 
Defense Business Council/Investment Review Board and non-programs of record 
software, hardware, maintenance, and support services.

National Intelligence Programs funds.
        (6) IT for industrial/base operating support (i.e., heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning, perimeter security, and anti-terrorism force 
protection) including all support service contracts regardless of contract 
value.
        (7) Ashore excepted network infrastructure assets including all 
support service contracts regardless of contract value.

communication devices, non-tactical radios, and telecommunication service 
support contracts regardless of contract value.
        (10) Back office IT that supports oversight and program management

Manager Air and Weapon Systems support (i.e., portals, hardware, and software 
tools, engineering services, financial management, installation, and support 
service contracts regardless of contract value).
        (11) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation laboratory network 
infrastructure that supports weapon system replication, trainers, ranges, and 
simulators, including all service and staff support contracts regardless of 
contract value.

    c.  In alignment with Department of the Navy (DoN)
Multi-Function Devices (MFD) policy, Echelon II Command Information Officers 
must continue to use Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) services for printing 
purchases.  If DLA cannot satisfy the printing requirements, a waiver request 
and Business Case Analysis (BCA) that includes a justification for deviating 
from using DLAs printing services recommendations must be submitted through 
NAV IDAS by the requestor.  Exception to using DLA or requesting an MFD 
waiver exists if you are requesting print services for NGEN.  All print 
services requests for NGEN must be submitted via your NGEN command 
representative. There is no requirement to submit an ITPRs for NGEN print 
services.
    d.  Commands shall continue to submit an ITPR for all software and 
maintenance products procured from any DoN Enterprise License Agreement

There are no exceptions or approval alternatives no matter the source of 
funding or core products that have been funded by the enterprise (e.g. oracle 
core products).  If a DoN ELA/ESI cannot satisfy the requirements, an 
automated waiver request that includes a justification for deviating from 
using DoN ELA must be submitted through NAV IDAS.  Catalog products, Blanket 
Purchase Agreement (BPA) software products, and core products centrally 
funded and paid annually must have ITPRs submitted within NAV IDAS. Software 
vendors will not initiate procurement actions without ITPR approval.
