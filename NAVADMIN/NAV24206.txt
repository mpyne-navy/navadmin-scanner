4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in 
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as determined 
by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), and assignment by Naval 
Service Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers 
Training Corps (NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree 
plan and acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC 
approved baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as 
Ensigns, USN. 
 
5.  Commanding Officers should take the following actions: 
    a.  Notify selectees and alternates of their selection and ensure they 
receive a copy of this message. 
    b.  Notify NSTC Selection and Placement Division (N92/STA-21) 
via e-mail at GRLK_STA21@us.navy.mil no later than 30 December 2024 of any 
selectee or alternate who does not desire to participate in the program. 
    c.  Immediately report to NSTC N92/STA-21 all conditions or circumstances 
that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
program via e-mail at GRLK_STA21@us.navy.mil. 
 
6.  Selectees and alternates shall take the following actions: 
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering corps, 
as applicable, in line with references (a) and (b) at a military treatment 
facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the enlisted 
standards required to remain on Active Duty. 
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals, Report of Medical 
History (DD Form 2807-1), and Report of Medical Examination (DD Form 
2808), including Human Immunodeficiency Virus results from a test 
taken after 1 January 2024, are submitted no later than 1 December 2024 to: 
 
Commander 
Naval Service Training Command 
Attn:  N92/STA-21 
320A Dewey Avenue BLDG 3 
ROOM 106 
Great Lakes, IL 60088-2845 
 
or via DOD-safe (https://safe.apps.mil/).  Aviation option 
selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded directly into 
Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office by a flight surgeon, and submitted to 
Naval Aerospace Medical Institute.  The selectees and 
alternates must be certified as qualified or have a waiver recommended by 
Naval Medicine Operation Training Center.  All required physical forms can be 
downloaded from the STA-21 homepage at 
https://www.netc.navy.mil/Commands/Naval-Service-Training-Command/STA-21/.   
Commands should not forward physical forms directly to BUMED. 
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above or via 
DOD-safe.  Application to more than one university is advisable.  Selectees 
will begin the STA-21 program with attendance at the Naval Science Institute 
(NSI) in one of two classes starting no later than 10 February 2025 or 31 
March 2025 for a 6-week period. 
    d.  Send an official degree plan from NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted.  Degree plans must cover 
the time actually attending college.  Degree plans of selectees should begin 
with the summer term 2025.  All STA-21 selectees will be required to attend 
the NSI enroute to their assigned university. 
 
7.  Alternates:  Each alternate must complete the same actions outlined in 
paragraph 6 of this message.  If a primary selectee declines participation in 
the program, is determined to be not physically qualified, or otherwise 
becomes ineligible for continuation in the program prior to executing orders, 
a qualified alternate will be selected.  This notification often comes at the 
last minute, therefore, alternates who desire participation in the STA-21 
program need to be complete with the actions listed above when notified. 
 
8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 1 December 2024.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of Permanent Change 
of Station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI enroute to their 
assigned NROTC University until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have 
been met. 
 
9.  The preferred method of delivery of all documents is through DOD-safe 
utilizing email GRLK_STA21@us.navy.mil (ensure an email with the encrypted 
passphrase is also sent to GRLK_STA21@us.navy.mil).  Documents can also be 
mailed to the address above. 
 
10.  The points of contact are: 
     a. Ms. Twana Williams, twana.l.williams.civ@us.navy.mil. 
     b. Mr. Jim Branch, james.r.branch8.civ@us.navy.mil. 
     c. Mr. David Burmeister, david.a.burmeister.civ@us.navy.mil. 
 
11.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
