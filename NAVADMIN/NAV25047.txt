1.  This NAVADMIN provides interim policy for U.S. Navy civilian employee 
travel. In accordance with references (a) through (c), the use of all 
government-issued travel charge cards by DON civilian employees is suspended 
for all travel that is not exempted, effective immediately.

2.  All requests for exempted travel must meet at least one of the exempted 
categories below and be validated and approved by the first Vice Admiral, 
Lieutenant General, or Tier III SES in the chain of command. This authority 
may not be further delegated. The approving official's name, rank, and date 
of approval must be documented in the travel orders, and all approved 
civilian travel must be documented IAW paragraph 7.
    a.  For Echelon II and below commands where the first VADM, LtGen, or 
Tier III SES in the chain of command is at Echelon I, submit civilian travel 
approval requests to the POCs lists in paragraph 8 for approval by the 
Director, Navy Staff (DNS).
Requests should include all data outlined in 7.a.

3. Exempted travel categories include:
    a.  Civilians traveling in direct support of military operations or a 
permanent change of station.
    b.  Mission critical travel including:
        (1) Training or exercises if participation is required to meet 
military training objectives.

4.  If a civilian's participation can be completed through use of Video 
Teleconferencing (VTC) or other digital means, travel will not be executed.

5. Travel that is not included in one of the exempted categories may not be 
authorized.  Navy civilian employees must cancel all future non-exempted 
official travel reservations, and those currently on non-exempted travel must 
return to their respective duty stations as soon as feasible.

6.  Requests to designate additional categories of travel as mission critical 
should be routed up the chain of command to DNS for adjudication by the
