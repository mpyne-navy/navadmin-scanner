3.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing that the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that each selectee will 
justify their selection time and again in their new career as Naval officers.
Those not selected are highly encouraged to seek out an LDO/Chief Warrant 
Officer in your area for advice on ways to grow professionally and improve 
opportunity for future selection.  Bravo Zulu to all who were willing to 
answer the call.

4.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) will deliver appointments to MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) Millington approximately 60 days prior to the 
commissioning date.  MNCC will forward appointments to the Transaction 
Service Center (TSC) Great Lakes, who will distribute directly to the 
respective Command Pay and Personnel Administrators.  TSC Great Lakes will 
also process the conversion from enlisted to officer status for LDOs, for all 
commands other than those who have the ability to process their own (CVN, 
SPECWAR, etc.).  TSC Great Lakes can be contacted directly at the below email 
address.

5.  Commanding Officers are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectee.
    b.  Notify Enlisted Career Administration (PERS-803) via official 
correspondence not later than 10 days following release of this message of 
selectees who do not accept appointment.  Selectees who decline their 
commission within this 10 day period will be considered by the FY-26 Enlisted 
Selection Boards.  After the 10 day period, Boards Active Enlisted / Reserve 
Enlisted will invalidate all FY-26 Active-Duty Navy Nuclear LDO In Service 
Procurement Selection Board selectees' eligibility for the FY-26 Active-Duty 
Enlisted Selection Boards.
    c.  Per reference (a), ensure LDO selectees obtain a commissioning 
physical within 90 days preceding the appointment month.  Notify the Nuclear 
LDO detailer (PERS-422B) upon completion.
    d.  Hold execution of all permanent change of station orders in abeyance, 
if applicable and immediately notify Enlisted Distribution Division of 
member's selection.
    e.  Administer official Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) within
4 months of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to 
Officer Indoctrination School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve 
satisfactory medium, notify PERS-422B.  Hold commissioning in abeyance until 
successful completion of PFA.
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified or if 
they fail to meet current PFA requirements. Immediately forward documentation 
citing reason to PERS-803.

6.  If a Nuclear LDO selectee's enlistment (including any extensions) expires 
after the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment eligible unless 
appointment is declined.

regard to personal information and history cards, and inform PERS-806 of 
address changes to facilitate appointment delivery.
