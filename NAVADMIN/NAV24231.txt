SUBJ/U.S. MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 
 
1.  Today, our Navy-Marine Corps team celebrates the 249th birthday of the 
Unites States Marine Corps! Nearly two and a half centuries ago, on November 
10th, 1775, the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and 
authorized the formation of two Marine Battalions to help achieve our 
Nation's independence in the Revolutionary War. 
In that war, our Marines would fight on the decks of our naval ships and on 
the beaches with our Continental forces.  And in every military engagement 
after that, throughout our Nation's rich and storied history, Marines have 
defended our Nation, deterred aggression, and upheld our way of life. 
 
2.  From the Halls of Montezuma and the shores of Tripoli to the beaches of 
Iwo Jima and the deserts of the Middle East, our United States Marines have 
answered our Nation's call with Honor, Courage, and Commitment.  With the 
title "First to Fight," there is no doubt that our Marines will continue to 
uphold their legacy of warfighting excellence, today, tomorrow, and in the 
future. 
 
3.  With our Fleet of amphibious warships, our aircraft, and our Warfighters, 
our team is the envy of the world.  No other Navy-Marine Corps team can 
train, deploy, and sustain such a lethal, combat-credible force at the pace, 
scale, and tempo we do.  America's Warfighting Navy is privileged to share 
the field with such elite and professional Warfighters. 
 
4.  Together, we are the world's preeminent fighting force. Together, we will 
continue to preserve the peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively in war, 
if called. 
 
5.  Happy 249th Birthday, Marines! Your active and reserve Navy Sailors and 
Civilians around the world are proud to celebrate this day and the legacy it 
represents with you.  Semper Fidelis! 
 
6.   Admiral Franchetti sends, 33rd Chief of Naval Operations.//
