SUBJ/249TH CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE//

1.  On 28 November 1775, the Continental Congress directed that divine 
services be held aboard all naval ships, and thus the Navy Chaplain Corps was 
born.  For 249 years, Navy Chaplains have cared for Sailors and Marines 
around the globe and through every conflict, at sea and ashore.

2.  Today, the men and women of the Chaplain Corps continue to focus on the 
"flock" that has been entrusted to us, attentive to our Northstar, Spiritual 
Readiness. As our Sailors and Marines have been standing the watch, around 
the world and around the clock, Navy Chaplains have been present, in times of 
joy, celebration, stress, doubt, or loss, offering a listening ear, wise 
counsel, a compassionate heart, and, most importantly, a connection to the 
Divine. Our commitment to their well-being changes lives, as their Spiritual 
Readiness directly impacts overall mission readiness. Each one of you plays a 
critical role in our Fleet. Thank you for your legacy of care and for living 
out Vocati Ad Servitium.

3.  Happy 249th Birthday, Chaplains.

4.  Released by RADM Gregory N. Todd, Chief of Chaplains.//
