RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN extends reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for Calendar Year (CY) 2025 Season One Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) for Active Component and Training and Administration of the 
Reserves (TAR) E5 and E6 Sailors.
MAP Season One runs from 15 March through 15 April 2025.  This season 
continues the added preseason window for commands to verify MAP user role 
access and Unit Identification Code (UIC) assignments in Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) ahead of the season.  The timeline in 
paragraph 3 contains details.

2.  MAP quotas are distributed over two seasons during CY25, with roughly 
half of the available MAP quotas allocated for each of the two MAP seasons.  
This aligns MAP with the Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) to ensure any 
unused MAP quotas are included in the NWAE cycle and to emphasize the intent 
of MAP to select and reward top- performing Sailors.  To meet required Time-
in-Rate (TIR) for MAP advancement eligibility, Sailors must have a date of 
rank no later than the following:
    a.  E5:  1 January 2024. 
    b.  E5 (Nuclear-trained Sailors):  1 January 2023. 
    c.  E4:  No TIR requirement.

3.  Timeline:
    a.  MAP Pre-season:  1-14 March 2025. 
    b.  MAP Quotas Uploaded:  14 March 2025. 
    c.  CY25 MAP Season One:  15 March - 15 April 2025.

4.  In line with reference (b), MAP advancement is not authorized for Sailors 
that participate in Billet Based Advancement (BBA).  BBA ratings that are not 
authorized for MAP are ABE, ABF, ABH, AME, AO, CS, DC, EM, IC, GM, GSM, MM, 
QM, and RS.  Sailors in these ratings have advancement opportunities via 
Command Advance to Position (CA2P).  In line with references (b) and (c), 
CA2P will be available for all Sailors not under orders or with orders 
pending release.
CA2P will eventually replace legacy MAP season execution for advancement to 
E5 or E6, with MAP quotas in future MAP seasons transitioning fully over to 
CA2P usage in the next calendar year (following the CY25 MAP seasons).  
Additional details are located on the MyNavy HRs DMAP website, 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-
Marketplace/.

5.  Commands are required to have two NSIPS MAP user roles (command reviewer 
and command reporting senior) in order to submit MAP advancements, Exceptions 
to Policy (ETP), and additional MAP quota requests through NSIPS.  NSIPS Web 
Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS should refer to paragraph 
5a for instructions on submitting their MAP advancements.  The system uses 
authoritative data to determine eligibility.  However, commands are required 
to locally validate that MAP candidates have successfully completed the 
Professional Military Knowledge Eligibility Examination (PMK-EE) requirement 
for E-5 and E-6 MAP advancements prior to the first day of the MAP season (15 
March 2025) as outlined in reference (d).  For training on user roles, log 
into NSIPS via https://www.nsips.cloud.navy.mil/, click on training tab, then 
click MAP tutorial (JPA).
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS must 
submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their Immediate 
Superior in Command (ISIC), Type Commander (TYCOM) or Budget Submitting 
Office (BSO)/Echelon II command using the Meritorious Certification Letter 
(MCL).  The letter must be signed by the commanding officer and should 
address any ETP or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs and detailed 
information regarding the offline process can be found via the MAP page on 
the MyNavy HR website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Community-Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/.
    b.  Quota usage, modifications, and distribution will be managed within 
the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be uploaded into NSIPS on 
14 March 2025 and can be found under the quota summary report tab.  Quotas 
can also be found via the MyNavy HR MAP page.
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option by 
the command reviewer user role.  Commands must contact their BSO to determine 
the timeline for additional quota requests.
Whether or not command quotas are authorized, all commands have the 
opportunity to request quotas from their BSO/Echelon II command, via their 
ISIC and TYCOM.
    d.  NSIPS will automatically determine if an ETP is required using 
predetermined criteria.  Sailors in ratings requiring security clearances and 
rates/pay grades requiring TIR waivers will be automatically routed for 
adjudication.  The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM, and 
BSO/Echelon II command using a hierarchical workflow.
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for Nuclear- trained 
Sailors.  Commands desiring to advance a nuclear-trained Sailor not meeting 
the TIR requirement must send notification to the Nuclear Enlisted Community 
Manager (N133D) at bullnuke@navy.mil.

6.  MAP Website.  MAP quotas by UIC, forms, and frequently asked questions 
can be found on MyNavy HR at: https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Community-Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/.
7.  Contact MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at (833) 330-6622 or by email at 
askmncc@navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
