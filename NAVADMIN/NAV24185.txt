SUBJ/OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY// 
 
RMKS/1.  As America's Warfighting Navy continues to operate far forward 
around the world, we must take a moment and recognize the exceptional 
individuals who work tirelessly behind the scenes to keep our Navy family 
afloat.  Today, I would like to express my sincerest appreciation to our 
hardworking Ombudsmen across the Fleet.  Their dedication, support, and 
service to our Sailors and their families is foundational to the well-being 
of our Navy team. 
 
2.  After five decades, our Ombudsmen continue to be critical members of our 
Navy team.  They are the key line of communication between our commands and 
our families, offering information and referral services that are essential 
to family readiness.  Our Navy Ombudsmen ensure that our Sailors and their 
families have access to the resources, guidance, and support they need while 
stationed at home and abroad. 
 
3.  It is through their tireless efforts, that our Sailors and their commands 
can focus on mission requirements all while knowing their families are in 
capable and caring hands.  Navy Ombudsmen help build a network of trust and 
support which is essential to the success of America's Warfighting Navy. 
 
4.  To all our Ombudsmen, thank you for your selfless service, devotion to 
duty, and hard work.  Your contributions are invaluable, and your impact to 
our Navy team is crucial to our shared success. 
As we continue to answer our Nation's call, know that your support continues 
to be the cornerstone of stability within the Fleet. 
Without you, none of what we do is possible. 
 
5.  Please join me in celebrating and expressing our deepest gratitude to our 
incredible Navy Ombudsmen.  Your efforts continue to make a profound 
difference, and for that we are eternally grateful. 
 
6.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations and
