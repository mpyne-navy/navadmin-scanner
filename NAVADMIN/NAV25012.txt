SUBJ/NAVFIT MODERNIZATION (CORRECTED COPY)//

REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/201951ZNOV23//

AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 279/23, NAVFIT98A AVAILABILITY AS ALTERNATIVE TO 
ENAVFIT.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the discontinuation of eNavFit and the 
modernization of NAVFIT98A for all Navy performance evaluations and fitness 
reports.  The NAVFIT modernization will meet the performance evaluation needs 
of Sailors at sea and ashore.  The modernization updates include NAVFIT98A 
functionality in Microsoft Office 365 (O365) and auto-validation tools to 
reduce submission errors and rejection rates.  It is scheduled to incorporate 
the upcoming revised Chief Petty Officer Evaluation in the spring of 2025.

2.  Effective 1 May 2025, eNavFit will no longer be available for Fleet use.  
Thanks to the valuable feedback from Sailors and a culture of learning 
throughout eNavFit development, the Navy is able to consolidate performance 
evaluation needs and services into a single platform:  a modernized and more 
capable NAVFIT98A.

3.  Commands should not start any evaluations or fitness reports in eNavFit 
after 15 March 2025 and must ensure all eNavFit performance appraisals are 
completed and submitted to Performance Evaluations Division Director (PERS-
32) before 15 April 2025.

4.  NAVFIT98A version 32 is being released Fleet-wide in January
2025 and will be compatible with both O365 and all workstations used by 
Sailors Service-wide.

5.  Beginning 1 April 2025, all evaluations and fitness reports are to be 
completed in NAVFIT98A version 32.  This new version combines the useful 
functionality of eNavFit, making it more user-friendly.
It also contains updated business rules that will significantly reduce the 
number of rejected reports received by Navy Personnel Command.

6.  For questions concerning NAVFIT98A, contact the MyNavy Career Center at 
(833) 833-6622 or via e-mail at askmncc@navy.mil.

7. This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
