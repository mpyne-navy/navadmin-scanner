SUBJ/2024 VICE ADMIRAL JAMES BOND STOCKDALE LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNERS 
(CORRECTED COPY)// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2024 recipients of the Vice Admiral 
James Bond Stockdale Leadership Award.  Commander Justin B. Smith, Commanding 
Officer, USS MASON (DDG 87) (U. S. Fleet Forces Command) and Commander Jason 
M. Garfield, Commanding Officer, USS STERETT (DDG 104) (U.S. Pacific Fleet) 
were selected for their inspirational leadership. 
 
2.  This Fleet award was established in honor of VADM James Bond Stockdale, 
whose distinguished Naval career symbolized the highest standards of 
excellence in both personal and professional leadership.  The award is 
presented annually to two commissioned officers on Active Duty in the grade 
of commander or below who are serving in command of a single ship, submarine, 
aviation squadron, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, Naval special warfare 
squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive ordnance 
disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit, or Navy special 
clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated by 
peers who themselves must be eligible for the award. 
 
3.  The 2024 winners were chosen from among six outstanding finalists in a 
review process that included screening at the Fleet commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers. 
 
4.  The following finalists deserve well-earned congratulations: 
    a.  CDR Robert A. Low, Commanding Officer, USS DELAWARE (SSN 791) 
    b.  CDR Tyler C. McQuiggan, former Commanding Officer, Strike Fighter 
Squadron ONE THREE ONE (VFA 131) 
    c.  CDR Erik H. Gustafson, former Commanding Officer, Helicopter Sea 
Combat Squadron FIVE (HSC 5) 
    d.  CDR Joseph S. Hamilton, Commanding Officer, USS PORTER (DDG 78) 
 
5.  CDR Justin Smith and CDR Jason Garfield, as well as all finalists, should 
be justifiably proud of their achievements. 
 
6.  Awards will be presented at a ceremony on 20 November 2024. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will be kept for record purposes, and will remain in effect 
until canceled or superseded, whichever occurs first.
