RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN authorizes Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on 
dependents location for members who choose to leave their dependents at the 
previous duty station or previously authorized dependent location in the 
Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii.  It implements 
reference (b). 
 
2.  In order to qualify for BAH at dependent location, the Service Member's 
dependents must be in CONUS, Alaska, or Hawaii, located in the vicinity of 
the previous Permanent Duty Station (PDS) or previously approved dependent 
location and the dependents must not have moved from that location. 
    a.  A housing allowance based on dependent location will not be paid 
under this authority for any location outside of CONUS, Alaska or Hawaii. 
    b.  Members with orders detaching from an accompanied tour in a foreign 
location or non-foreign United States territory are not authorized to receive 
BAH for dependent location under this authority. 
    c.  Entitlement to BAH based on dependent location will cease if the 
dependents move from the vicinity of the approved location.  Any overpayments 
will be recouped. 
 
3.  Members are only authorized to receive a single housing allowance under 
this authority.  If receiving a housing allowance for their dependent's 
location, the member will not receive a housing allowance for their PDS.   
Family Separation Allowance may be authorized if requirements in reference 
(a) are met.  Additionally, members approved under this authority are only 
authorized to occupy unaccompanied government quarters on a space available 
basis. 
Service Members should note that unaccompanied government quarters are 
limited and should not be relied upon in their financial calculations. 
 
4.  Members must be aware of the financial implications of maintaining a 
residence at their PDS and at their dependents location.  Members are 
encouraged to discuss their situation with their command financial specialist 
prior to electing to geographically separate from their family. 
 
5.  All requests made under this NAVADMIN will be submitted to Commander, 
Navy Personnel Command (PERS-451).  Branch Head, Military Pay and 
Compensation Branch (OPNAV N130) will serve as the ultimate authority for 
appeals.  A complete package must contain: 
    a.  Member's request.  The request must state that the member understands 
the potential financial implications of electing to receive BAH based on 
dependent location and that the dependents reside at the address on the 
NAVPERS 1070/602.  The request must acknowledge the affirmative duty of the 
member to tell their command if their dependents move from the previous PDS 
or previously approved dependent location. 
    b.  Current Commanding Officer's endorsement. 
    c.  Current PCS orders. 
    d.  Current NAVPERS 1070/602 (Page 2). 
    e.  For subsequent requests, a copy of previous determination(s). 
 
6.  This NAVADMIN is effective 1 October 2024.  Members that have dependents 
at a previous duty station can request BAH for that location, but the start 
date for that BAH will be no earlier than 1 October 2024. 
 
7.  Commands with questions regarding this NAVADMIN are encouraged to contact 
their local Transaction Service Center (TSC) for clarification.  TSC 
Personnel with questions may contact:  PERS-451 at pers451@navy.mil. 
 
8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
