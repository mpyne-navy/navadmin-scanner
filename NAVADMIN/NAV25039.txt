RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Spring Fiscal Year (FY) 
2025 Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Officer Transfer and 
Redesignation Board to be held on 28 April 2025.  Applications from qualified 
Active Component (AC) and Selected Reserve (SELRES) officers will be 
considered by this board.
In line with reference (a), this board will also accept applications from TAR 
officers requesting redesignation into another TAR officer community.

2.  Applicants can find requirements and procedures via the MyNavy HR Portal 
at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Officer/Reserve-OCM/TAR/TAR-Redesignation/.  Completed 
applications with associated enclosures must be received no later than 2359 
Central Time (CT) on 23 March 2025.  Letters to the board must be received no 
later than 2359 CT on 17 April 2025.

3.  Eligibility.
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
references (a) and (b), in addition to the Spring FY25 TAR eligibility 
criteria document and the following:
        (1) Projected Rotation Date (PRD).  Applicants should have a PRD no 
later than 31 October 2026.  Waiver requests must be endorsed by the 
applicant's Commanding Officer on the command endorsement.
        (2) Minimum Service Requirement (MSR).  AC applicants should have 
completed their MSR prior to 31 October 2026.  Waiver requests (no additional 
documentation required by the applicant) will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis by the applicant's AC Officer Community Manager (OCM).
        (3) Year Group.  All AC applicants are subject to AC OCM manning 
needs, and all TAR applicants are subject to TAR OCM manning needs.  No 
action is required by the applicants.
        (4) Aviation Bonus (AvB).  Aviation officers with obligated service 
as a result of AvB are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 
months of completing AvB obligation or Department Head tour at the time the 
board convenes.  Redesignation immediately following a department head tour 
may result in cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation 
Officer Assignments (PERS-43).
        (5) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a two-time
(2x) FOS status for promotion to Lieutenant Commander are eligible to apply 
for TAR regardless of MSR and AvB contract term, and a waiver request is not 
required.  SELRES officers in a 2x FOS status seeking transfer/redesignation 
to a TAR community are eligible to apply. Those SELRES officers with three or 
more FOS are not eligible.
    b.  All AC applications will be routed by the TAR OCM through the 
applicable AC OCM for community release prior to applications being sent to 
the board.  Applicants not released by the AC OCM will not be eligible for 
the board.  AC officers with a resignation submitted in the Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System and in routing at Navy Personnel Command, or 
Lieutenants in a 2x FOS status are eligible to apply and do not require AC 
OCM release.
    c.  Limited Duty Officers who possess a four-year baccalaureate degree 
are eligible to apply for the TAR program.  Chief Warrant Officers are not 
eligible to apply.

4.  Officers applying for multiple aviation platforms will be selected based 
on qualifications and Navy mission requirements.

5.  In addition to the TAR communities applied for, applicants may be 
considered for selection by the TAR community associated with the applicant's 
current designator, if an equivalent TAR community exists (e.g., 1520 may be 
considered for 1527, even if the applicant does not list 1527).

6.  For officers applying to TAR Pilot or Naval Flight Officer (NFO) Aviation 
communities, this board will additionally consider applications for 
redesignation into TAR in a Reserve Management capacity.  Upon completion of 
all Aviation tanks, aviation applicants not selected for their requested 
communities will be screened for TAR opportunity in Reserve Management 
positions.
Aviation applicants desiring a non-flying opportunity may also request to be 
screened for this tank by indicating it on their application preferences.  
Officers selected for this transition will be offered TAR conversion to 
redesignate as 13X7, but will not be detailed in a Department Head or flying 
status, and therefore are not eligible for the TAR Aviation Department Head 
Retention Bonus (ADHRB).  Members selected for this community would remain 
eligible to reapply for TAR Aviation Department Head selection on future TAR 
redesignation boards, subject to the applicable TAR Community Management 
quota limitations at that time.  Please contact the TAR Aviation OCM for 
additional questions regarding this opportunity.

7.  All officers selected via the TAR Transfer and Redesignation Board will 
incur a three-year TAR obligation.  All TAR obligations will begin on the 
date they redesignate as a TAR officer, unless otherwise stated in reference 
(c).

8.  Upon approval of the board proceedings, the results of the board will be 
posted on the TAR redesignation board website.  Applicants can expect to see 
the results posted within 30 days of board adjournment.  Within two weeks of 
the board results being posted, selectees will receive an acceptance package 
and will have 10 days upon receipt to accept or decline TAR transfer or 
redesignation.

9.  Points of contact:
    a.  CDR Elijah J. Waddle, Director of Affiliation and Redesignation 
(PERS-92), (901) 874-4512/DSN 882 or elijah.j.waddle.mil@us.navy.mil.
    b.  PS1(SW) Nicole Stewart (PERS-92), (901) 874-4832/DSN 882 or at

10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
