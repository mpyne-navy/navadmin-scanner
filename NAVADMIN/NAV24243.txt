SUBJ/2024 THANKSGIVING MESSAGE// 
 
RMKS/1.  America's Warfighting Navy: as we celebrate Thanksgiving this year, 
MCPON Honea and I want to express our sincere thanks to each and every one of 
you.  There is no doubt that our Navy-Marine Corps team has been in high 
demand this past year, and we could not be more proud of all we have 
accomplished around the world. 
 
2.  In the Middle East and Mediterranean, our teams are delivering decisive 
combat power and knocking down airborne threats at a rate not seen since 
World War II.  In the Indo-Pacific, our Warfighters are defending the rules-
based international order and upholding regional security and stability 
alongside our Allies and partners. 
In the Atlantic, the Baltic, and the High North, our Navy continues to work 
alongside NATO and other partner Navies to deter Russian aggression.  And in 
the Southern Seas, our Fleet is operating on the maritime frontlines, forging 
partnerships with other like-minded nations and delivering power for peace. 
Every day, our Navy team has lived up to our legacy, operating far forward to 
deter aggression, respond in crisis, and be ready to fight and win 
decisively, if called. 
 
3.  Today we give thanks for our shipmates and fellow servicemembers standing 
the watch and we give thanks to our families and broader support networks for 
their own service and sacrifice.  We cannot do what we do every day without 
their support and encouragement. 
 
4.  This Thanksgiving, no matter where you are, we hope you find the time to 
connect with family, friends, and shipmates, and reflect and give thanks. 
Please remember that holidays like this can be a challenging time for some of 
our shipmates. Look out for each other and continue to help our people 
connect their dot to our mission. 
 
5.  The U.S. Navy remains the world's preeminent fighting force, and we are 
grateful for the work you, our active and reserve Sailors and civilians, do 
every day to make it that way. 
 
6.  Happy Thanksgiving, Team Navy! We are honored to serve alongside you. 
 
7.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, 33rd Chief of Naval Operations 
and MCPON J. M. Honea, 16th Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
