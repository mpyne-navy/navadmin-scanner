NARR/REF A ANNOUNCED TRANSITION PTDY AUTHORIZATION FOR ELIGIBLE 
PERSONNEL, REF B IS MODIFICATION OF PTDY.  REF C IS MILPERSMAN 6810400, 
REF D IS DOD PRESEPARATION GUIDE, AND REF E IS HIV SCREENING PRIOR TO 
SEPARATION FROM MILITARY SERVICE.//
RMKS/1. THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO ANNOUNCE AN EXTENSION OF 
PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY DUTY (PTDY) AUTHORITY FROM 30SEP95 TO 30SEP99.  
CLARIFY WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO USE PTDY, ADDRESS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
AND TO DISTINGUISH PTDY FROM ANOTHER PROGRAM, PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY 
ADDITIONAL DUTY (TAD), WHICH IS AUTHORIZED FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

2. THE INTENT OF PTDY, AS AUTHORIZED BY REFS A AND B, WAS TO EASE 
TRANSITION FROM MILITARY-TO-CIVILIAN LIFE CAUSED BY REDUCED, 
CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED, MILITARY END STRENGTH LEVELS.  PTDY ALLOWS 
VSI/SSB, INVOLUNTARY SEPARATEES AND RETIREES, ADDITIONAL TIME FOR 
PRESEPARATION-JOB SEARCH AND HOUSE HUNTING.  PTDY MAY BE GRANTED FOR UP 
TO 20 DAYS (IF THE MEMBER WILL BE PROCESSED FOR SEPARATION INCONUS) AND 
UP TO 30 DAYS IF SEPARATION PROCESSING OCCURS OCONUS.  THE INTENT OF 
THE ADDITIONAL 10 DAYS FOR OCONUS PROCESSING IS TO ALLOW ROUND TRIP 
TRAVEL FROM OVERSEAS IN ADDITION TO 20 DAYS INCONUS PRIOR TO SEPARATION 
FROM AN OCONUS LOCATION.  PTDY IS TO BE USED FOR BONA FIDE JOB 
SEARCH/HOUSE HUNTING AND IS NOT TO BE USED AS A FORM OF NON-CHARGEABLE 
LEAVE.  MEMBERS WHO MEET THE CRITERIA ARE ELIGIBLE, NOT ENTITLED, TO 
PTDY.  COMMANDING OFFICERS SHOULD BE CONSISTENT IN GIVING 
APPROVAL/DISAPPROVAL BASED ON MEMBER MEETING THE ELIGIBILLITY 
REQUIREMENTS AND DEMANDS OF COMMAND’S READINESS AND MILITARY MISSION.

3. PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY (PTAD) AS DESCRIBED IN REF C IS 
A SERVICE POLICY, AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAW OR THE DOD 
TRANSITION BENEFITS PACKAGE.  PTAD DEALS ONLY WITH A MAXIMUM OF 10 
CONSECUTIVE DAYS HOUSE HUNTING LEAVE BETWEEN PERMANENT DUTY STATIONS 
(PDS), NOT WITH JOB/HOUSE HUNTING UPON SEPARATION OR RETIREMENT.

4. RECENTLY, DOD PUBLISHED THE PRESEPARATION GUIDE (REF D).  THE 
PRESEPARATION GUIDE ERRONEOUSLY STATES THAT VOLUNTARY SEPARATEES ARE 
ALLOWED 10 DAYS JOB/HOUSE HUNTING.  THIS IS INCORRECT.  THE OFFICE OF 
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (OSD) IS IN THE PROCESS OF CORRECTING THIS 
ERROR.

5.  ANSWERS TO OTHER FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT PTDY:
	A. PTDY ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF JOB/HOUSE HUNTING ONLY 
	APPLIES TO:
		(1) MEMBERS DISCHARGED OR RELEASED FROM ACTIVE DUTY AS 
		INVOLUNTARY SEPARATEE UNDER HONORABLE CONDITIONS, OR;
		(2) MEMBERS WHO ARE APPROVED FOR THE VSI/SSB PROGRAM, OR;
		(3) ALL RETIREES (INCLUDING ENLISTED MEMBERS TRANSFERRING 
		TO THE FLEET RESERVE).
	B. PTDY ELIGIBILITY FOR A MEMBER WHO IS DISCHARGED FOR MEDICAL 
	REASONS: A MEMBER MAY BE ELIGIBLE UPON RECEIPT OF SEPARATION ORDERS AND 
	CO’S APPROVAL NOT BOARD FINDINGS THAT RECOMMEND DISCHARGE.  SEPARATION 
	ORDERS GIVE FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING PTDY.  IF MEMBER IS GRANTED 
	ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE AWAITING ORDERS AS A RESULT OF DISABILITY 
	PROCEEDINGS, PTDY SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED.  PTDY IS NOT INTENDED FOR 
	MEMBERS ON THE TEMPORARY DISABLED RETIRED LIST (TDRL).  REQUEST FOR 
	WAIVERS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED VIA MESSAGE TO PERS-271.
	C. REQUIRED HIV SCREEN PRIOR TO SEPARATION FROM MILITARY SERVICE: 
	REF A ALLOWS TERMINAL LEAVE, PTDY AND PROCESSING DAYS TO BE COMBINED 
	NOT TO EXCEED 100 DAYS.  REF 3 REQUIRES THAT SEPARATING MEMBERS MUST 
	HAVE A DOCUMENTED HIV TEST WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SEPARATION.  AUTHORIZING 
	COMMANDS SHOULD TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATIN WHEN APPROVING REQUESTS.  
	FOR WAIVER OF REF E 90 DAY WINDOW, FAX REQUEST TO NMMC 0220, (310) 295-
	5021.
	D. CONSECUTIVE USE OF PTDY DAYS: PTDY MAY BE AUTHORIZED FOR UP TO 
	20/30 DAYS INCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS AND RUNS CONSECUTIVELY AS 
	DOES PTAD.  WHILE PTDY MAY BE TAKEN IN INCREMENTS, AS LONG AS THE TOTAL 
	NUMBER OF DAYS DOES NOT EXCEED 20 DAYS INCONUS OR 30 DAYS OCONUS, 
	LIBERTY MAY NOT BE AUTHORIZED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PTDY TO EXTEND THE 
	TOTAL PERIOD OF PTDY BEYOND 20/30 DAYS.  APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF PTDY 
	IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUTHORIZING COMMAND.
	E.  ELIGIBILITY OF RESERVISTS RECALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY:  MEMBER 
	MUST HAVE BEEN ON ACTIVE DUTY ON 30 SEP 1990 TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PTDY.

6. PSD, PASS LIAISON REPRESENTATIVE (PLR), AND CAREER COUNSELORS SHOULD 
BE THE POC FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PTDY PROGRAM.  IF THE COMMAND 
POC REQUIRES CLARIFICATION THAT CANNOT BE ANSWERED BY REFS A AND B OR 
THIS MESSAGE, CONTACT THE BUREAU OF NAVAL PERSONNEL.

7. POC FOR PTDY POLICY: PERS-201C, DSN 224-5633/COMM (703)614-5633.
