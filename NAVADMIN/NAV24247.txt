RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal and modification of the Surface 
Warfare Officer (SWO) Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Retention Bonus (LRB) for 
eligible SWOs.

2.  Program Authority.  This program is authorized under section 332, Title 
37 U.S. Code.  In line with reference (a), the SWO LRB is effective through 
30 September 2027 unless otherwise rescinded or superseded.  All applications 
for the bonuses contained within this program will be submitted to the Navy 
Personnel Command SWO Assignments (PERS-41) for approval, payment processing, 
and tracking.

3.  Program Overview.  This message summarizes the provisions of the SWO LRB.  
All information provided herein is applicable to both Active Component (AC) 
and Training and Administration of the Reserves (TAR) SWO personnel, except 
where otherwise noted.  The following general summary is provided:
    a.  SWOs promoted to LCDR will have the opportunity to commit to the SWO 
LRB.  The Navy will pay qualified officers for 3 years of obligated service 
from the completion of the 12th Year of Commissioned Service (YCS) through 
the completion of their 15th YCS.
LCDRs with at least 11 YCS, but not more than 12 YCS, are eligible for the 
SWO LRB.  AC SWOs will receive a $22K bonus on the anniversaries of their 
12th, 13th, and 14th YCS.  In line with references (a) and (b), TAR SWOs will 
receive $12K on the anniversaries of their 12th, 13th, and 14th YCS.
    b.  Officers currently under SWO LRB contract are not eligible for the 
new payment structure and renegotiation of the current SWO LRB contracts.
    c.  References (b) and (c) limit career retention bonus amounts.
While officers may receive multiple retention bonuses under section
332 of reference (b) over a career, total bonus payments under this authority 
may not exceed $300K for AC officers and $150K for TAR officers.

4.  Program Eligibility
    a.  Must meet all four of the following requirements:
        (1) Qualified and serving as an Active Duty SWO (designators
1110 or 1117),
        (2) Permanently appointed LCDR.
        (3) Have at least 11 YCS, but no more than 12 YCS.
        (4) Completed two afloat Department Head (DH) tours, a single longer 
tour, or be within 12 months of periodic rotation date for late DH options on 
the flexible career path according to the DH sequencing plan as assigned by 
PERS-41.
    b.  If assigned to an at-sea tour by PERS-41, eligible officers must be 
sea duty assignable as defined by reference (d).
Additionally:
        (1) An officer under contract and assigned to an at-sea tour and 
evaluated as no longer fit for sea duty by an appropriate medical authority, 
following a period of Temporary Limited Duty (TLD), will have a stop payment 
placed on their account and receive no further SWO LRB payments.  However, an 
officer on TLD who is reasonably expected by the assigned medical officer to 
make a full recovery and be found fit for sea duty will continue to receive 
scheduled payments.  This determination will be completed by PERS-41 in line 
with the appropriate medical authority's findings.
        (2) An officer found unfit for continued Naval Service by an 
appropriate medical authority will have a stop payment placed on their 
account and receive no further SWO LRB payments.
        (3) Should a previously ineligible officer later become fit for sea 
duty, payments will resume at normal intervals for the remainder of the 
anniversary payment(s).  Retroactive pay is not authorized for any bonus 
payments that were scheduled during the period the officer was ineligible.
    c.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An officer participating in CIP 
will be ineligible to receive LRB payments during the intermission period.  
Scheduled payments will resume upon return to service and in line with the 
payment structure.
    d.  Operational Deferment.  An officer in an operational deferment status 
will remain eligible to receive LRB payments.
    e.  An officer is not eligible to receive both the SWO Department Head 
Retention Bonus (DHRB) and LRB concurrently.
    f.  Bonuses will be paid in line with the payment structure in paragraph 
6.

5.  Program Execution
    a.  The SWO community manager is assigned as the program manager and is 
delegated the authority to administer the SWO LRB program according to 
applicable laws, Department of Defense directives/instructions and this 
NAVADMIN.
    b.  PERS-41 receives applications submitted in the format referenced in 
paragraph 7.  PERS-41 is delegated the authority to:
        (1) Evaluate eligibility of SWOs applying for the SWO LRB program.
        (2) Approve SWO contracts to remain on Active Duty for the stated 
period in exchange for a SWO LRB.
        (3) Administer LRB payments.
    c.  All applications require written endorsement from the applicant's 
Commander, Commanding Officer (CO), or equivalent superior in charge.
    d.  Officers under a LRB agreement are not eligible to apply for the 
Permanent Military Instructor (PMI) program, or any redesignation programs 
that result in a change to any designator other than 1110 or 1117.  An 
officer under a LRB agreement may submit an application for PMI or any 
redesignation program once the date of application is within 12 months of the 
final day of bonus obligation.

6.  LRB Payment Structure
    a.  Applications for LRB must be submitted between the 11th and 12th YCS.  
Approved applicants will receive payments on the anniversary of their 12th, 
13th, and 14th YCS.  In the case of SWO LCDRs approved for the late DH career 
path who complete their SWO DHRB obligated service after the completion of 12 
YCS, the 3 years of obligated service for the SWO LRB may begin immediately 
after the completion of SWO DHRB obligated service.  For example, officers 
who elect for a late DH tour start would normally conclude their DHRB 
obligated service at 12 YCS and would be eligible to apply for LRB bonus in 
line with the prescribed application window described in paragraph 4.a(3).  
If approved, those officers will still receive LRB bonuses in line with the 
pay schedule.
    b. SWO AC officers (1110) will receive the LRB in line with the following 
payment structure ($66K maximum):
        (1) $22K on the YCS-12 anniversary;
        (2) $22K on the YCS-13 anniversary;
        (3) $22K on the YCS-14 anniversary;
    c. In line with reference (a) through (c), TAR officers may only receive 
a maximum of $12K per year in bonuses.  SWO TAR officers
(1117) will receive the LRB in line with the following payment structure 
($36K maximum):
        (1) $12K on the YCS-12 anniversary;
        (2) $12K on the YCS-13 anniversary;
        (3) $12K on the YCS-14 anniversary;

7.  Application Process
    a.  General Notes
        (1) Application format can be found on the PERS-41 page of the NPC 
website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-41-SWO/Pay-Incentives/
        (2) Applications will be binding upon the date of approval by  
PERS-41.
        (3) Applications received in the incorrect format or not meeting 
eligibility requirements defined in this NAVADMIN will be rejected.
    b.  Officers must submit a copy of the signed original contract and CO's 
endorsement by e-mail to the applicable assignment officer and/or civilian 
assistant.

8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed by section 
373 of reference (b) and reference (e).  A Service Member of the uniformed 
Services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the member fulfills the conditions of the written agreement.  If the 
member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the written 
agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the Service Member 
may be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of the pay.  
SWO LRB payments will be stopped for officers who become ineligible for this 
incentive or fail to complete the full period of additional obligated 
service.
    a.  For officers who die while serving under a SWO LRB service agreement, 
the remaining SWO LRB balance will be paid as a lump sum as part of the 
settlement of the final military pay account of the officer.  If death is 
determined to be the result of the misconduct of the member, future payments 
will be stopped and unearned portions of the bonus will be recouped, as 
applicable, in line with procedures established for members whose inability 
to complete a contracted period of service is voluntary or the result of 
misconduct.
    b.  Recoupment exception to policy determinations will be made by 
Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy Division (OPNAV N13).

9.  Additional guidance, information, and updates regarding the SWO LRB are
