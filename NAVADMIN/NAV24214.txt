RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge (CAC) training 
requirement. 
 
2.  Per references (b) and (c), Navy personnel, civilians, and contractors 
with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete the 
Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 1 September 2025. 
 
3.  Personnel who completed CAC 2024 after 30 September 2024 but before CAC 
2025 version is available, will receive credit for their annual FY25 
training. 
 
4.  Total Workforce Management Services (TWMS) is the readiness platform used 
to track CAC completion percentages for the Navy.  Commands and training 
platforms must confirm TWMS is capturing all CAC completions under the 
overarching requirement ID set by CNIC/TWMS Administration (TWMS Requirement 
ID: 76689 FY25 DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge) to receive credit.  Commands 
are prohibited from creating additional CAC training requirements to set 
command specific training metrics.  This requirement cannot be waived.  The 
options below are the authorized methods for training delivery: 
    a.  Commands can elect to complete CAC training using instructor-led 
    delivery.  A command designated cyber security professional such as the 
    Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) or Cyber Workforce Program 
Manager(CWF-PM) must provide the instruction. 
    b.  Total Workforce Management Service(TWMS), https://twms.dc3n.navy.mil; 
 
    c.  Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil/;  
(Note:  The My Navy Portal, https://learning.nel.navy.mil/ELIAASv2p/  
redirects users to the NEL link)); 
    d.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) 
website, https://cyber.mil/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/; 
    e.  Waypoints, https://don.csod.com; 
    f.  Other approved training sources, DISA Digital Video Discs (DVDs). 
 
5.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  The CAC 2025 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator using the normal manual NIAPS distance 
support update process.  If unable to download Learning Management System Pub 
Amendment 112, ships can request a DVD with these files to be mailed by 
submitting a support request to Navy 311. 
 
6.  Although CAC training is an individual responsibility, commanders and 
commanding officers are accountable for completion by 100 percent of their 
personnel.  Effective 1 September 2020, the DoD Cybersecurity Hardening 
Scorecard collects information on the number of users who completed annual 
Cybersecurity Awareness training and the scorecard is briefed on a quarterly 
basis to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Training officers are responsible 
for ensuring their personnel complete and properly document the required 
training. 
 
7.  Command training officers must validate training via TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS) 
(https//ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/fltmps/) authoritative databases. Training 
officers will manually record training completed via the DISA website, DISA 
DVDs, or instructor-led.  Manually record training in FLTMPS using the 
Learning Event Completion Form.  Report any discrepancies to the Navy 
Training Management Planning System Operational Support office at 
ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 922-1867. 
 
8.  The Command ISSM is responsible for reporting compliance to meet Federal 
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.  Command ISSMs 
will disable accounts of users who do not complete training by 1 September 
2025 and maintain non-compliance list of accounts that were disabled. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded. 
 
10.  Released by VADM Karl O. Thomas, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
