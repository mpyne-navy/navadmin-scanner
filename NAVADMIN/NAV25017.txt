Administration of the Reserves (TAR) and Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors. 
References (a) through (c) removed MAP opportunities for E2 through E4

in Service (TIS).  In order to give apprentice band Sailors an opportunity to 
advance, E4 MAP will run from 1 February through 31 December 2025.

2.  E4 MAP quotas will be distributed throughout CY25 to select and reward 
the top-performing Sailors to be advanced prior to reaching 30 months TIS. 
E3 Sailors must have a minimum of 12 months TIS to be eligible for MAP to E4.

3.  Timeline:  CY25 E4 MAP Season:  1 February - 31 December 2025.
