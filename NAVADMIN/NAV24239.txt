RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the modification of the Naval Special 
Warfare Officer Retention Bonus (NSWRB) for qualified Naval Special Warfare 
(NSW) officers.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference(a).  Retaining NSW 
officers is a priority for the Navy.  The NSWRB is a flexible retention 
incentive that focuses on improving retention of NSW control grade 
officers.  NSW officers who meet the eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN 
and hold an 1130 or 1137 designator may apply for this incentive. 
 
2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under Section 332 of 
reference (b) and reference (c).  As of 18 September 2024, eligible officers 
will be offered the opportunity to commit to a 5 or 3 year agreement for 
bonus amounts listed in paragraph 5.  NSW Program Management (OPNAV N137) is 
designated as the NSWRB program manager. 
All applications for this bonus will be submitted to the program manager for 
approval, payment processing, and tracking.  The eligibility criteria stated 
in this NAVADMIN can be changed at any time by the program manager if a bonus 
reduction is warranted based on the needs of the NSW community. 
 
3.  Eligibility.  NSW officers with designators 1130 or 1137, who have 
completed 15 Years Commissioned Service (YCS), may be eligible to receive the 
NSWRB.  Applicants must receive written endorsement from their Commanding 
Officer (CO) recommending bonus approval. CO's must ensure applications are 
accurate and verify applicants meet eligibility requirements. 
 
4.  Program Execution 
    a.  Officers must submit their request letter to the NSWRB program 
manager via their chain of command. 
    b.  Upon acceptance of a bonus agreement by the program manager, the 
amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the officer incurs a firm service 
obligation from requested bonus start date. 
    c.  Officers may elect one of the following payment options: 
        (1) To receive an initial lump sum payment of half the total bonus 
amount followed by equally divided annual installments through the term of 
the agreement. 
        (2) To receive bonus payments in equal annual installments through 
the term of the agreement. 
    d.  NSWRB requests for personnel who are being processed for officer 
designation removal or additional qualification designation removal will be 
held in abeyance pending final resolution of the action in question. 
 
5.  Contract Terms.  NSWRB contract lengths and payments are outlined below:

prior to their requested start date and should confirm receipt.  Applications

reference (b), Sections 332, 373 and reference (d).  A Service Member of the 
uniformed services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the Service Member fulfills the conditions of that written agreement.  If 
the Service Member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the 
written agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the Service 
Member shall be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion 
of the pay.
