RMKS/1.  The term "General Military Training (GMT)" used in previous 
NAVADMINs has been replaced with "Common Military Training (CMT)." 
In line with reference (b), CMT refers to non-core training intended 
for completion by all Service Members. 
 
2.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 CMT requirements for 
all Navy personnel.  These requirements stem from directives issued by 
Congress and the Department of Defense as outlined in references (a) through 
(l).  In our ongoing pursuit of readiness amidst evolving challenges, the 
preparedness of each individual remains pivotal to our operational edge.  CMT 
equips Sailors with essential foundational training aimed at safeguarding 
fellow personnel, securing our operational capabilities, and defending our 
networks and critical information-fundamental principles enhancing our 
effectiveness as warfighters. 
 
3.  In response to Fleet feedback, the Navy has streamlined the required CMT 
topics.  Requests for alternative training to fulfill CMT requirements may be 
submitted to the CMT program sponsor for approval. 
 
4.  Mandatory CMT Topics 
      a.  In line with reference (b), annual mandatory topics for FY25: 
        (1) DoD Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Training. 
        (2) NCIS Counterintelligence and Insider Threat Awareness 
            and Reporting. 
        (3) DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge 2025. 
        (4) Operations Security (OPSEC) Annual Training. 
        (5) Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Awareness. 
        (6) Suicide Prevention. 
        (7) Records Management in the DoN: Everyone's Responsibility. 
        (8) Harassment Prevention and Military Equal Opportunity. 
        (9) Antiterrorism Level 1 Awareness Training. 
 
5.  Situational CMT Topics: 
    a.  Situational CMT topics are not mandatory for all Navy personnel.   
Instead, they are available for individual unit training as decided by 
Commanding Officers.  This approach empowers Commanders to optimize training 
needs unique to situational and operational requirements. 
    b.  Situational Topics: 
        (1) Combatting Trafficking in Persons. 
        (2) Domestic Violence for All Hands. 
        (3) Substance Abuse. 
        (4) Financial Readiness. 
        (5) DoN Privacy Act Training. 
        (6) Tactical Combat Casualty Care. 
        (7) Countering Extremist Activity. 
        (8) Crew Endurance and Fatigue Management. 
        (9) Foreign Malign Influence (FMI) Training and Awareness. 
        (10) Traumatic Brain Injury Training for Service Members. 
 
6.  Detailed information on mandatory and situational CMT topics and guidance 
for training delivery is available on MyNavy Portal (MNP): 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/training-education-qualifications/cmt. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or until  
30 September 2025, whichever occurs first.
