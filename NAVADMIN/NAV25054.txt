RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN implements new requirements for completing and 
submitting the Department of Defense Basic Enrollment form (DD Form 2366, SEP 
2022) for the Montgomery GI Bill Act of 1984 (MGIB).
All other MGIB election requirements outlined in references (a) and
(b) remain in effect.

2.  In an effort to streamline the submission process for DD Form 2366, 
Service Members will use the online, self-service version of this form that 
is available in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS), 
effective immediately.  This NAVADMIN does not apply to Sailors who have 
already made their MGIB election.
    a.  DD Form 2366 will be certified electronically within NSIPS by a 
designated command certifying official.
    b.  Commands whose Sailors are unable to complete the DD Form
2366 via NSIPS should refer to reference (a) paragraph 7.
    c.  DD Form 2366 will automatically transmit to the official military 
personnel file, in line with reference (b), and to the My Navy Career Center 
(MNCC) Human Resources Service Center (HRSC) for required MGIB disenrollment 
transactions.
    d.  After 270 days, the self-service option will not be available in 
NSIPS to the member and they should contact their command pay and personnel 
administrator or MNCC HRSC for further assistance.

3.  For specific instructions on completing and submitting DD Form 2366, 
refer to training presentation at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Education/GI-Bill/MGIB-Enrollment/ or contact MNCC HRSC at (833) 
833-6622 or askmncc.fct@navy.mil.

4.  For questions concerning MGIB policy, contact Ms. Shania Truelove at 
shania.m.truelove.civ@us.navy.mil.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
