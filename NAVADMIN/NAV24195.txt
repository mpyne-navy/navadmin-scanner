RMKS/1.  The annual SECDEF Awards Program recognizes the Department of 
Defense's (DoD) most outstanding field-level and depot-level military 
maintenance units from a highly competitive field of candidates.  I would 
like to extend my congratulations and gratitude for all Navy units that 
submitted nomination packages in accordance with references (a) and (b).  
Each nominee should be proud of their accomplishments.
