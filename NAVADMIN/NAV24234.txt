REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/19APR18// 
AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN 1306-964, RECRUITING DUTY.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the next application window for positions on 
the Navy Electronic Sports (Esports) team as primary team members and 
auxiliary team members by Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC).  The 
Navy Esports team significantly contributes to the multi-faceted outreach 
campaign of CNRC by engaging with prospective Sailors online and at gaming 
venues. 
Centennials are moving into digital spaces for most of their content 
consumption and social interactions, and the Esports domain is one of the 
most popular and vibrant online arenas to date.  Connecting with future 
Sailors requires the Navy to be in the same spaces where those future Sailors 
reside. 
 
2.  Open to all Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) Sailors, the 
qualifications to become a primary team member are identical to the 
qualifications needed for recruiting duty.  Refer to reference (a) for 
further details.  Those selected as auxiliary team members will be required 
to have access to all necessary gaming equipment and peripherals to 
participate in tryouts and future virtual events, need an up-to-date 
government travel card with completed required training, have command 
endorsement to participate in events, and meet in game ranking requirements 
for specific titles. 
 
3.  Upon selection as primary team members, AC Sailors will receive a set of 
3 year orders and RC Sailors will receive a set of 2 year definite recall 
orders to CNRC in Millington, Tennessee.  All primary team members receive 
recruiting training at Navy Recruiter Orientation Unit (NORU), Pensacola, 
Florida, enroute to CNRC.  The intent of NORU training will be to further 
develop communication skills and to ensure that team members understand the 
types of information sought by those inquiring about service in the Navy. 
 
4.  Upon selection as auxiliary team members, Sailors will receive a 
designation letter sent to their current command which will remain effective 
until their projected rotation date.  Once an auxiliary team member completes 
a permanent change of station from their current duty station, they will not 
be restricted from trying out again as an auxiliary team member.  However, 
they will need to complete the tryout process again. 
 
5.  Primary team members will operate at the Navy Esports facility, which is 
specifically designed for the team to practice, stream, and compete.  Upon 
arrival at CNRC, they will develop a routine streaming cadence, encouraging 
followers and viewers to interact with the members and outreach content, and 
compete against high schools, colleges, and Esports league events across the 
country. 
 
6.  Auxiliary team members will operate primarily from their permanent duty 
station unless selected to perform at a designated alternate location for 
events.  Upon selection as auxiliary team members, they will develop routine 
practice schedules with other team members for upcoming events.  They will 
encourage followers and viewers to interact with Goats & Glory social media 
platforms, and compete year-round in high school, college, and Armed Forces 
Esports League events across the country. 
 
7.  Team member applications will be accepted via a continuously open web 
portal at https://www.cnrc.navy.mil/Esports/
