RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN directs Fleet-wide implementation of the Sexual 
Assault Incident Response Oversight (SAIRO) (8-day) Report, required by law, 
which accounts for actions taken, or in progress, to provide the necessary 
care and support to the victim of an assault, verify referral of the 
allegation of sexual assault to the appropriate Military Criminal 
Investigative Office (MCIO), and to provide initial notification to the 
service member*s chain of command as required by reference (a).  The SAIRO 
(8-day) Report is a one-time Situational Report (SITREP) required within 
eight calendar days following the initial OPREP-3 Navy Blue or OPREP-3 Navy 
Unit SITREP for an adult sexual assault.  The SITREP format mandated by this
NAVADMIN is an interim measure pending the release of a fillable form. The 
fillable form will be available later this year and will replace the SITREP 
format imposed by this NAVADMIN.

2.  Effective immediately, the SAIRO (8-day) SITREP is required when an adult 
sexual assault is reported involving a service member victim or a service 
member alleged offender (including reserve component members who were 
performing active service or inactive duty training during the time of the 
assault) per reference (b).  This requirement only applies to unrestricted 
reports made to a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC), Deployed 
Resiliency Counselor (DRC), or Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Victim 
Advocate (SAPR VA) and to independent investigations initiated by the MCIO 
per references (c) through (e).  A SAIRO (8-day) SITREP is not prepared for 
sexual assaults involving Family Advocacy Program cases, consistent with 
references (f) through (h).

3.  An individual, one-time SAIRO (8-day) SITREP is required for each victim 
involved, regardless of affiliation, status or location of the victim or 
alleged offender.  Per reference (a), the SAIRO (8-day) SITREP is required 
for all unrestricted reports of sexual assault incidents, including incidents 
(being reported at the present time) that occurred before the enlistment or 
commissioning of the service member victim, with the understanding that some 
alleged offender information may not be accessible or available.

4.  The eight-day requirement begins upon initial notification and resultant 
initial OPREP-3 Navy Blue or OPREP-3 Navy Unit SITREP of any of the below:
    a.  An unrestricted report is made to a SARC, DRC, SAPR VA, or Unit SAPR 
VA (UVA) via a Victim Reporting Preference Statement (DD Form 2910).  The 
SARC will contact the victim*s commanding officer (CO) within 24 hours, or 48 
hours if there are extenuating circumstances in deployed environments.  This 
requirement does not affect the preexisting requirement for the SARC to 
contact the installation CO per references (c) and (d).
    b.  The victim elects to convert a previously filed restricted report to 
an unrestricted report via DD Form 2910.
    c.  The MCIO notifies the CO that an independent investigation has been 
initiated by the MCIO.

5.  For a SAIRO (8-day) SITREP triggered by an unrestricted report of sexual 
assault, the SARC will be responsible for providing all victim information 
and the MCIO will provide the incident data and investigation information.  
For a SAIRO (8-day) SITREP triggered by an independent MCIO investigation, 
the MCIO will be responsible for providing the available information.  
Incident data shall not be acquired through a command-directed investigation 
which is prohibited for sexual assaults in accordance with (IAW) references 
(a) through (e).  At a minimum, the CO preparing the SAIRO (8-day) SITREP 
will provide preliminary information of the incident with the understanding 
that some victim or alleged offender information may not be accessible or 
available.

6.  Restrictions.  Privacy is of the utmost importance.  Information 
contained in the SAIRO (8-day) SITREP shall not be requested from the victim 
and such information shall be limited in distribution to personnel with an 
official need-to-know while ensuring control of sensitive information.  
Personally identifiable information (PII) shall not be included.  The SARC 
will report non-PII concerning sexual assault incidents (without information 
that could reasonably lead to personal identification of the victim or the 
alleged offender).  For example, depending on the size of the unit or the 
gender make-up of the unit, it may not be appropriate to include gender, 
rank, or grade.

7.  Reporting Responsibility.  Without disclosing protected communications 
and victim confidentiality, the SAIRO (8-day) SITREP will be prepared and 
submitted by the CO with input from the SARC and the MCIO (e.g., NCIS) IAW 
reference (a) and as follows:
    a.  In reports involving a service member victim or a service member 
alleged offender, the following will be responsible for submitting the SAIRO 
(8-day) SITREP:
        (1) The CO of the victim and alleged offender if the victim and 
alleged offender are assigned to the same command.
        (2) The CO of the victim if the victim and the alleged offender are 
assigned to different commands.
        (3) The first O-6 or above Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) in 
the chain of command if the CO is the alleged offender.
    b.  The CO of the victim involving a service member victim and a non-
service member alleged offender.
    c.  The CO of the alleged service member offender involving a civilian 
victim will prepare and submit a SAIRO (8-day) SITREP containing available 
information.

8.  Notification requirements.  In addition to notification requirements in 
reference (i), the SAIRO (8-day) SITREP will be sent to the below listed 
individuals:
    a.  The installation CO, if such incidents occurred on or in the vicinity 
of a military installation.
    b.  The chain of command of the victim and/or alleged offender, up to and 
including the first Flag officer.
    c.  The ISIC of the service member alleged offender if the alleged 
offender is a CO or Flag officer.

9.  The SAIRO (8-day) SITREP will be submitted no later than eight calendar 
days following the initial OPREP-3 Navy Blue or OPREP-3 Navy Unit SITREP 
required by reference (i).  At a minimum, the CO preparing the SAIRO (8-day) 
SITREP will provide preliminary information of the incident, with the 
understanding that some victim or alleged offender information may not be 
accessible or available.

10.  Report format requirement.  The SAIRO (8-day) SITREP will include the 
following specific information in the GENTEXT/INCIDENT IDENTIFICATION AND 
DETAILS section of the OPREP-3 Navy Blue or OPREP-3 Navy Unit SITREP required 
by reference (i):
     a.  Victim information (non-PII) provided by the SARC.
        (1) Victim gender, duty status, service affiliation, assigned 
command, grade, and current geographic area where the victim is assigned and

dependent, DoD contractor, foreign national, or non-government civilian.
        (2) The date the victim was referred to the SARC, SAPR VA, or UVA.
        (3) If an unrestricted report of sexual assault was made to a SARC,

adversely affected the command*s ability to address the victim*s needs (e.g.,

reprisal, if any) if the victim accepted SAPR services.  The SARC will 
include any victim input provided with documented victim consent for 
disclosure of privileged communications per reference (c).  The SARC will 
confirm that the victim was informed of the ability to speak to a Victims* 
Legal Counsel (VLC) before providing consent for release of privileged 
information.
