Rmks/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the 2026 Navy 
Legislative Fellows Program. The Legislative Fellows Program allows 
naval officers (O-3 to O-5), senior enlisted (E-7 to E-9), and 
Department of the Navy civilian employees (GM/GS-13 and above or 
equivalent)to broaden their understanding of the legislative process 
and the operation of the U.S. Congress through a year-long, full- 
time assignment to the office of a member of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate. The Legislative Fellows Program also 
enhances the ability of the Navy to fulfill its role in the national 
policy development process. Typical responsibilities of a fellow 
include drafting legislation, hearing preparation, analysis of 
public policy, and serving as a congressional liaison to 
constituents and industry. 
 
2.  To succeed in this highly competitive program, applicants should 
have exceptional written and verbal communication skills, display 
mature and critical thinking, and show a proven ability to work 
in a dynamic environment. Records should reflect sustained superior 
performance and potential for future assignments in critical 
billets. Upon completion of the program, officers earn the 
Legislative Fellowship Additional Qualification Designation (AQD 234). 
 
3.  Military Applicants. The program is available to both Officers 
and Enlisted. 
    a.  Officer Applicants. Participation is open to all Active Duty 
and Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) unrestricted 
line, restricted line, and staff corps officers in the permanent 
grades of O-3 through O-5. The selection process will focus on 
individual performance, promotion potential, academic and 
subspecialty qualifications, needs of the Navy, and availability 
for follow-on assignment. Officers with permanent change of station 
orders already issued will not be considered. All officer applicants 
must contact their detailers for counseling on the career impact of 
participation in the Legislative Fellowship Program. Officers should 
plan for an immediate follow-on utilization tour or assignment upon 
completion of the fellowship, in line with Ref (a). 
    b.  Enlisted Applicants. Participation is open to all Active Duty 
Navy ratings in the permanent grades of E-7 through E-9. The 
selection process will focus on individual performance, promotion 
potential, academic and additional qualifications, needs of the 
Navy,and projected rotation date. Sailors with permanent change of 
station orders already issued will not be considered. Following the 
fellowship, Sailors will be assigned to a single 24-month 
utilization tour supporting a role determined by the Office of 
Legislative Affairs (OLA). 
    c.  All military applicants must be available for permanent 
change of station assignment to the Washington, DC, area in November 
2025. Following orientation at OLA, fellows will begin a 12-month 
assignment in January 2026 in a Congressional office. In accordance 
with reference (b), upon execution of orders, fellows must agree in 
writing to serve on active duty following completion or termination 
of the fellowship for a period of three times the duration of the 
fellowship. 
    d.  In addition to the application requirements listed in
