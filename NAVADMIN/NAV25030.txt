RMKS/1.  This message reiterates the guidance in references (a) through (d) 
and reminds all Navy personnel of Operations Security (OPSEC) best practices 
and the requirement for pre-publication release review.

2.  Today our Navy is operating in the most complex, challenging, and 
contested information environment in history.  Adversaries seek to gain and 
exploit vital Navy information through open source means such as social media 
posts, websites, publications, and public facing events.  They identify, 
aggregate, and analyze multiple streams of unclassified information regarding 
Navy presence, capabilities, intent, readiness, timing and location of our 
operations, research and development programs, infrastructure, and networks.  
An integral safeguard for unclassified but critical Navy information is 
proper use of OPSEC.

3.  OPSEC is every Sailor's responsibility, from E-1 to O-10.  OPSEC is more 
than an annual training requirement.  It is common sense application of 
thoughtful and deliberate actions on a daily basis to minimize exposure of 
Navy information to actors who aim to undermine Navy's warfighting 
advantages.  As a rule, you should assume that adversaries will view anything 
not hidden and read anything not secured or encrypted.

4.  Social media platforms are important means to broaden public knowledge of 
America's warfighting Navy.  They also present a great challenge to proper 
OPSEC.  Avoid posting sensitive Navy information related to the categories in 
paragraph 2 and ask your family members to do the same. To update an old 
expression: "Loose tweets sink fleets."

5.  While open discussion is necessary for any professional organization, 
special considerations must be made to limit an adversary's ability to gain 
and exploit insights into our vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and shortcomings.  
Pre-publication review is a critical (and mandated) measure that ensures Navy 
professionals do not inadvertently disclose sensitive information in opinion 
pieces or scholarly articles.

6.  Accordingly, all hands must submit any products for publication to their 
command OPSEC officer or Public Affairs Officer (PAO) for review prior to 
release into the public domain.  Commands should seek outside review from 
appropriate subject matter experts or authorities if the topic is not within 
their mission area.  For assistance, reach out to the OPNAV OPSEC Program 
Manager listed at the top of this message, and use the following websites: 
Defense office of prepublication and security review website 
(https://www.esd.whs.mil/dopsr/) and the Naval OPSEC Support Team website, 
reference (d).

7. Public facing events like air shows, fleet weeks, Navy community 
symposiums, and industry days are important forums to engage with the 
American public and Navy stakeholders. As with social media and publications, 
applying common-sense OPSEC measures during public facing events makes Navy 
information a harder target and safeguards Navy technology, operations, and 
people.

8. Released by VADM Karl O. Thomas, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
