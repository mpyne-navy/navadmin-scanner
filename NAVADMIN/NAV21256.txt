RMKS/1.  Purpose.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance to Commanders regarding 
Navy service members who fail to obey a lawful order by refusing the COVID-19 
vaccine directed in references (a) through (c). 
 
2.  Policy.  In order to ensure a fully vaccinated force, U.S. Navy policy is 
to process for separation all Navy service members who refuse the lawful 
order to receive the COVID-19 vaccination and do not have an approved 
exemption.  Specific administrative actions are directed herein, however, 
additional administrative actions and any punitive actions based solely on 
vaccine refusal continue to be withheld. 
 
2.a.  The least favorable characterization of service for Navy service 
members refusing the vaccine, without extenuating circumstances, will be 
GENERAL (under honorable conditions).  A general discharge will, at the 
discretion of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), result in the loss of 
eligibility for some VA benefits such as the GI Bill, to include the transfer 
of GI Bill benefits to dependents. 
 
2.b.  Navy service members with approved or pending COVID-19 vaccination 
exemption requests shall not be processed for separation or be subject to the 
other administrative actions described in this NAVADMIN due solely to their 
lack of COVID-19 vaccination.  However, in line with reference (d), Navy 
service members who are not vaccinated, regardless of exemption status, may 
be temporarily reassigned with concurrence of the first flag officer in the 
administrative chain of command based on operational readiness and mission 
requirements.  Where applicable, the first flag officer in the operational 
chain of command should be notified regarding temporary reassignments. 
 
2.c.  Navy service members whose COVID-19 vaccination exemption request is 
denied are required to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as directed by the 
exemption adjudicating authority or commence vaccination within 5 days of 
being notified of the denial, if the exemption adjudicating authority does 
not specify.  Navy service members who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine after 
expiration of the specified time to commence vaccination, will be processed 
for separation and be subject to the other administrative actions described 
in this NAVADMIN and reference (d). 
 
2.d.  Navy service members who initiate vaccination such that they cannot 
meet the deadline described in references (b) and (c) or the applicable 
deadline established by receipt of an exemption denial, should notify their 
chain of command as soon as possible.  The Navy service members command must 
expeditiously report the case to the COVID Consolidated Disposition Authority 
via *PERS-834(at)navy.mil* for officers and 
*PERS832COVIDVAXADSEPS(at)us.navy.mil* for enlisted, in order to expedite 
determination regarding whether to initiate or suspend administrative 
separation and the other actions directed by this NAVADMIN. 
 
2.e.  Notwithstanding the policy to separate Navy service members refusing 
the vaccine, each and every Navy service member shall be treated with dignity 
and respect at all times throughout the execution of the policies described 
herein. 
 
3.  Definitions. 
 
3.a.  Navy Service Members.  Active-duty service members and service members 
in the Selected Reserve only.  Service members in the Individual Ready 
Reserve and U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) and Naval Reserve Officers Training 
Corps (ROTC) midshipmen remain subject to the vaccine mandates in references 
(a) through (c), but will be adjudicated per their governing instructions. 
 
3.b.  Active-Duty Navy Service Members.  Active-duty Navy service members 
include members of the Active Component and members of the Reserve Component 
on active duty in a full time support (FTS) status (also known as Training 
and Administration of the Reserve (TAR)). 
 
3.c.  Refusing the Vaccine.  A Navy service member refusing the vaccine is 
one who has: (1) received a lawful order to be fully vaccinated against 
COVID-19, (2) is not or will not be fully vaccinated on the date required by 
the order, and (3) does not have a pending or approved exemption request per 
references (e) through (h). 
 
3.d.  Fully Vaccinated.  Service members are considered fully vaccinated two 
weeks after completing an approved COVID-19 vaccination series per reference 
(c). 
 
3.e.  Commanders.  Commanders, Commanding Officers and Officers-in-Charge of 
naval units or organizations. 
 
4.  General Guidance. 
 
4.a.  Continue to hold submission of administrative separation (ADSEP) cases 
or convening administrative separation boards until directed by the CCDA. 
 
4.a.(1).  Final directions for submission of misconduct and ADSEP requests 
based solely on vaccine refusal are expected to be promulgated during the 
first week of December 2021.  In preparation for submission, Commanders shall 
prepare Reports of Misconduct, applicable NAVPERS 1070/613s and any other 
supporting documents. Templates and additional information can be found at 
 
*https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Personnel-Conduct-
Sep/Officer-Performance-Separation/* and
*https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Personnel-Conduct-
Sep/Enlisted-Separations/*.  A NAVPERS 1070/613 specifically written for
Navy service members who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine is located at
*https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-covid-19-reporting*   
for Commanders use. 
 
4.a.(2).  Entry Level Separation (ELS).  Commanders will continue separation 
of Navy enlisted service members refusing the vaccine who meet ELS criteria 
per MILPERSMAN (MPM) 1910-154.  In accordance with MPM 1910-600, forward 
completed administrative separation records to PERS-832 via email at 
*PERS832COVIDVAXADSEPS(at)us.navy.mil* for filing in members official 
military personnel file (OMPF). 
 
4.b.  Commanders will notify those Navy service members refusing the vaccine 
who are executing funded or no-cost TAD orders for training, or any other 
official purpose, to halt their assigned activity and return to their command 
within five working days. 
 
4.c.  Generally, Navy service members refusing the vaccine will continue in 
their assigned duties pending adjudication of separation processing and other 
applicable administrative actions described within this NAVADMIN.  Commanders 
shall ensure appropriate risk mitigations remain in place to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19.  If, in the Commanders judgment, a local reassignment 
becomes necessary, Commanders should coordinate disposition and timing with 
their Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC). 
 
5.  Administrative Disposition Guidance. 
 
5.a.  The data reporting required by NAVADMIN 249/21, reference (k), meets 
the requirements of MPM 1611-010 (officers) and MPM 1616-040 (enlisted) to 
inform PERS-834 (officers) and PERS-832 (enlisted) of incidents that could 
result in adverse action for officers and enlisted (E-6 through E-
9).  However, if a Navy service member refusing the vaccine (including those 
E5 and below) has a pending transfer,  promotion or advancement: submit the 
additional information, as described below, as soon as feasible to ensure 
appropriate preemptive action is taken.  Include *COVID-19 Vaccine Refusal* 
in the subject line of the email.

7.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders execution guidance. Navy service 
members refusing the vaccine who are under PCS orders will adhere to the 
following guidance. 
 
7.a.  Navy service members and dependents who have not yet initiated PCS 
travel shall not execute orders.  Commands are directed to contact Navy 
Personnel Command (NPC) for follow-on guidance per MPM 1611-010, MPM 1616-
040, and MPM 1616-050.  NPC is standing by to address each specific case and 
will authorize entitlements based on current location and situation. 
 
7.b.  For Navy service members and/or dependents who have already initiated 
PCS travel, detaching and gaining commands shall make every effort to contact 
those service members to advise them of the requirements of this 
message.  The service member should contact their detailer directly and each 
case will be evaluated by NPC on a case by case basis.  Commands are directed 
to contact NPC for follow-on guidance per MPM 1611-010, MPM 1616-040 and MPM 
1616-050. Per MPM 1320-308, members traveling under orders are considered to 
be attached to the gaining command. 
 
7.c.  Commanders should contact their ISIC to discuss impacts on manning 
resulting from this PCS orders execution guidance.  ISICs should discuss 
manning impacts with their respective Type Commander N1, officer and enlisted 
community detailers, and placement coordinator (PERS 4013). 
 
7.d.  For new accession Navy service members in the accession training 
pipeline, (e.g. Recruit Training Command and A and C Schools) who refuse the 
vaccine and do not have a pending exemption request, Commanders will 
immediately interrupt their training, place them in an Interrupted 
Instruction (II) status and hold them at current activity. 
 
7.e.  For new accession Navy service members in the accession training 
pipeline, (e.g. Recruit Training Command and A and C Schools) who have a 
pending exemption request, Commanders will continue their accession level 
training (including transfer between schools), but will not transfer them to 
their ultimate assignment until adjudication of their exemption 
request.  Once complete with all available accession level training, 
Commanders will place the service member in an Interrupted Instruction (II) 
status and hold them at current activity until the exemption request is 
adjudicated. 
 
8.  Bonuses, Special Pays and Incentive Pays.  Navy service members refusing 
the vaccine may not enter into any new agreements for bonuses, special pays, 
or incentive pays and any unearned portion of current bonuses, special pays 
and incentive pays will be recouped in accordance with references (r) through 
(u).  Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: career 
retention bonuses, enlistment bonuses and incentive pays (such as flight 
pay). Bonuses, special pays and incentive pays become unearned when a Navy 
service member refusing the vaccine is no longer performing duties for which 
they are receiving such a bonus, special pay, or incentive pay (i.e. removed 
from assignment). 
 
8.a.  Bonuses, special pays and incentive pays become unearned as soon as one 
of the following criteria is met: 
 
8.a.(1).  Removed from the assignment. 
 
8.a.(2).  Associated NEC/AQD/warfare qualification is removed. 
 
8.a.(3).  Separated. 
 
8.b.  Actions required by Commanders with regard to special and incentive 
pays. 
 
8.b.(1).  For assignment or incentive pays, if a Navy service member is 
removed from an assignment, the Commander shall notify the office responsible 
for any special and incentive pays of the change of assignment.  For 
Assignment Incentive Pay (AIP), notify PERS-40DD via email at 
*Mill_aip(at)navy.mil*.  For Special Duty Incentive Pay notify PERS-40DD via 
email at *Mill_sdip(at)navy.mil*.  For Special Duty Assignment Pay, notify 
the servicing Personnel Support Detachment/Transaction Support Center and the 
rating detailer. 
 
8.b.(2).  For bonuses, if a Navy service member is removed from an assignment 
and is no longer eligible for a bonus, notify the office responsible for that 
bonus.  For Selective Reenlistment Bonuses, notify OPNAV (N130) via email at 
*nxag_N130D(at)navy.mil*. 
 
8.b.(3).  Upon removal from an assignment, Commanders will ensure the NAVPERS 
1070/613 specifically written for Navy service members refusing the vaccine 
is completed and saved in the service members electronic service 
record.  This NAVPERs 1070/613 can be found at 
*https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-covid-19-reporting*.
 
 
9.  Education.  Navy service members refusing the vaccine are not eligible to 
continue Navy education opportunities and those who fail to complete a 
service obligation incurred for participating in Navy funded full-time, part-
time, or off-duty education programs per OPNAVINST 1520.23C will be required 
to reimburse the cost of the education received, prorated for the obligated 
time served. 
 
9.a.  Institutional Education.  Navy service members refusing the vaccine who 
incurred a service obligation for an education benefit (e.g. USNA, ROTC, 
Naval Postgraduate School, Health Professional Scholarship Program or in-
residence Professional Military Education), will have any unearned portion of 
that education benefit recouped if separated before completing the service 
obligation.  Navy service members refusing the vaccine (as defined in para. 
3) currently enrolled in such an education program will be dis-enrolled from 
their program as soon as feasible and held at their institution or command 
pending administrative separation.  Note: Current USNA and ROTC Midshipmen 
will be adjudicated by governing instructions as discussed in para. 3.a. 
 
9.b.  Tuition Assistance (TA).  Navy service members refusing the vaccine are 
ineligible to receive TA.  Commanders must withdraw command approval for any 
TA courses not yet convened.  Commanders will direct withdrawal from TA 
courses which have convened and require proof of withdrawal.  Navy service 
members will be responsible for reimbursing the Navy for the amount listed on 
the TA Authorization Voucher.  Officers administratively separated prior to 
completing the statutory two year obligation for receipt of TA will incur a 
debt. 
 
9.c.  SkillBridge.  Navy service members refusing the vaccine are not 
eligible to participate in the SkillBridge program.  Commanders will 
immediately remove SkillBridge approval and recall Navy service members 
refusing the vaccine as indicated below. 
 
9.c.(1).  Navy service members assigned to commands in the Continental United 
States (CONUS) will return to their permanent duty station at their own cost 
within five days of recall order.  If the command is deployed or underway, 
Sailors will report to the Transient Personnel Detachment in their home port. 
 
9.c.(2).  Navy service members assigned to commands outside the Continental 
United States (OCONUS) will report to the nearest CONUS Transient Personnel 
Detachment at their own cost as directed by their command within five days of 
recall order. 
 
9.d.  Navy Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL).  Navy service members 
refusing the vaccine are not eligible for Navy COOL funding for examinations 
or related credentialing fees.  Commanders will withdraw approval of 
unexecuted vouchers and withhold future voucher approval for Navy service 
members refusing the vaccine. 
 
10.  Navy Training.  In cases where there is a clearly defined service 
obligation that is not met, the cost of Navy training will be recouped, 
prorated to the obligated time served.  Additionally, each case of a Navy 
service member refusing the vaccine will be evaluated for recoupment of 
training costs based on individual circumstances such as total cost, service 
obligation, and the Navy’s realized return on investment for training 
received. 
 
11.  Reenlistments and Extensions.  Navy service members refusing the vaccine 
are not eligible for re-enlistment, and may not extend their enlistment.  If 
a Navy service member refusing the vaccine has entered into an extension 
agreement that is not yet operative (has not yet taken effect), Commanders 
must cancel these agreements to extend enlistment.  The inoperative extension 
can be cancelled by the personnel office by completing the cancellation 
section of NAVPERS 1070/621 or NAVPERS 1070/622 and processing the 
corresponding NSIPS event per MPM 1160-040. 
 
12.  Promotion and Advancement.  Navy service members refusing the vaccine 
who are in a frocked status should be defrocked as soon as feasible (officers 
per SECNAVINST 1420.2B, enlisted per BUPERSINST 1430.16G).  Spot promoted 
officers refusing the vaccine should be replaced as soon as feasible.  Once 
removed from the applicable spot promote billet, the command should contact 
the members detailer and PERS-806 to remove the spot promotion. 
 
12.a.  Officer Promotion Delay.  Commanders shall delay the promotion of any 
officer refusing the vaccine and shall submit a NAVPERS 1070/13 to 
*NPC_promotionwithholds.fct(at)navy.mil* stating the members promotion is 
delayed due to COVID-19 vaccine refusal (per SECNAVINST 1420.3 or SECNAVINST 
1412.6M).  Delays shall be based upon pending administrative action and 
physical qualification. Navy Personnel Command will make formal written 
notice to the officer following notification from the Commander.  A NAVPERS 
1070/613 specifically written for Navy service members who refuse 
the COVID-19 vaccine is located at 
*https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-covid-19-reporting* for Commanders use. 
 
12.b.  Enlisted Advancement Withhold.  Commanders shall withhold the 
advancements of any enlisted member refusing the vaccine, to include 
preventing automatic Time-In-Rate advancements for E-2/E-3 and advancement 
for any Sailors in a frocked status for paygrades E-3 through E-9. 
 
12.c.  Enlisted Advancement Withdrawal.  The date of the special adverse 
evaluation from paragraph 6.b. above constitutes a permanent withdrawal of 
advancement recommendation effective as of the date of the reporting seniors 
signature.  An example NAVPERS 1070/13 for enlisted members pending 
advancement is available in BUPERSINST 1430.16G, Chapter 7. 
 
13.  Community sponsor flag officers are authorized to make determinations 
within their communities regarding removal of warfare qualifications, 
additional qualification designations (AQD), Navy Enlisted Classifications 
(NEC), or sub-specialties for Navy service members refusing the vaccine.  Any 
decision to remove warfare qualifications, AQDs, NECs, or sub-specialties 
shall be consistent with current community policies and normal practices for 
Navy service members who do not maintain deployability or individual 
readiness through their own actions.  These decisions, when based solely on 
refusing the vaccine, must be administrative in nature rather than punitive. 
 
14.  If in doubt as to how to adjudicate issues related to a Navy service 
member refusing the vaccine, Commanders should seek guidance from their chain 
of command, their staff judge advocate, and/or the CCDA before acting.  In 
all cases, Commanders are accountable to ensure the health and safety of 
their command while treating every Navy service member with dignity and 
respect.
