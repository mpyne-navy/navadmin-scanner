RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Nuclear Enlisted Talent Management Board 
Pilot Program (TMBPP).  The Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP provides career oriented 
nuclear trained Sailors the opportunity to pursue unique career enhancing, 
personally fulfilling, and professionally rewarding experiences.  The Nuclear 
Enlisted TMBPP seeks to create a managed competitive marketplace for high 
performing nuclear trained Sailors.  This first iteration of the Nuclear 
Enlisted TMBPP is a Pilot Program for Fiscal Year 2025.  The Nuclear Enlisted 
TMBPP is directly aligned with the Navy's responsibility of making fiscally 
disciplined investments focused on enabling the enduring tenets of 
"warfighting first," "operate forward" and "be ready" through the development 
of joint warfighters, technical experts, and strategic leaders, allowing 
Sailors to develop skills and knowledge aligned to the highest priorities in 
maritime and defense strategies.

2.  Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP Overview.  The Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP offers 
nuclear trained Sailors on their First Sea Tour (SEA-1) an opportunity to 
compete for the most selective programs in the Navy.
SEA-1 Sailors who meet the eligibility requirements listed in paragraph 4 may 
apply to the Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP.  The Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP will then 
convene, select Sailors, and announce results in line with paragraph 3.  
Selected Sailors will obligate for service as detailed in paragraph 5, then 
issued orders for their selected Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP opportunity.

3.  Application Timeline.  Two Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP will be held each year, 
in the spring and the fall.  Subsequent TMBPP dates will be announced online

required to reenlist in Selective Reenlistment Bonus Zone B for 6 years.

6.  Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP Opportunities.  The opportunities for each Spring 
and Fall Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP will be posted online at

Kingdom), Legislative Fellowship, White House Fellowship, SECNAV tour with

Fellowships, White House Fellowships, and SECNAV Tours with Industry) require 
Sailors to apply to an additional board for that particular program.
Applicants selected by the Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP will have their package 
fully endorsed by the nuclear community.  In the event that a TMB endorsed 
Sailor is not selected by the program specific board, the Sailor will be 
afforded the opportunity to pick from a Nuclear Enlisted TMBPP opportunity 
within the control of the Enlisted Nuclear Community Manager.
