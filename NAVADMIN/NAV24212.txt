SUBJ/CNO BIRTHDAY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET// 
 
1.  America's Warfighting Navy, it's time to reflect on our rich naval 
history as we celebrate our 249th Birthday - 249 years of Navy 
"Warfighting Strength and Readiness." 
 
2.  The birth of our Navy came nearly a year before our Nation's 
independence.  On October 13, 1775, during the early months of the 
Revolutionary War, our bold and daring Continental Sailors set sail for 
Boston to deliver America its first dose of Warfighting Advantage.  From that 
point on, there was no turning back.  The Great American Experiment was truly 
underway and with it the legacy of our United States Navy. 
 
3.  Over the centuries, battles, and wars since, our Navy Sailors have 
continued to deliver Warfighting Advantage, always ready to preserve the 
peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively in war, if called. 
 
4.  From the Eastern Mediterranean to the Indo-Pacific and everywhere in 
between, our Sailors have been standing the watch, around the world and 
around the clock, in every domain from seabed to space, and in cyberspace.   
No other Navy in the world can train, deploy, and sustain such a lethal and 
combat credible force at the pace, scale, and tempo we do.  All of this has 
been made possible by you, America's Warfighting Navy.  Each one of you plays 
a critical role in our Fleet.  You are truly our secret weapon. 
 
5.  As we look to the future and the decisive decade ahead, we know that our 
team will continue to answer our Nation's call and build on our Navy's legacy 
with Honor, Courage, and Commitment. 
 
6.  We could not be more proud of each and every one of you, our active and 
reserve Sailors and Navy civilians who contribute to our Navy's success every 
day.  Please extend our thanks to your families for their own service and 
sacrifice.  We could not do what we need to do every day without their love 
and support. 
 
7.  Happy 249th Birthday, Shipmates.  See you in the Fleet. 
 
8.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations and 
MCPON J. M. Honea, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
