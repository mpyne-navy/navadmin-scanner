RMKS 1. Per reference (a), all U.S. Navy commands and activities with Navy 
and Marine Corps personnel will conduct an Active Duty Fund Drive (ADFD) in 
support of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society
(NMCRS) from 1 March to 30 April 2025. For over 121 years, NMCRS has been a 
constant source of strength for our Naval Services, standing shoulder-to-
shoulder with our Sailors, Marines, and families at sea and ashore. The 
campaign theme, "By Our Own, For Our Own," embodies our shared commitment to 
take care of those whom we serve alongside.

2. In 2024 alone, NMCRS directly helped over 48,000 service members on our 
Navy-Marine Corps team, providing over $50 million in critical financial 
assistance. The confidential financial assistance NMCRS provides our Sailors 
and Marines peace of mind during financial crises, keeping them mission ready 
and focused on the defense of our Nation.

3. NMCRS does not receive government funding and relies on contributions from 
Active Duty and retired Sailors and Marines as well as other supporters.

4. Success in meeting our goal requires involved leadership at all levels. 
Early assignment of motivated fund drive coordinators and other key roles 
ensure we reach 100 percent of our Sailors and Marines. Staying engaged 
throughout the drive allows our people to learn about the important programs 
and services NMCRS provides and offers opportunities to donate.

5. During the NMCRS ADFD, Sailors and Marines are authorized to endorse, 
support, and participate in fundraising events as long as commands and 
organizations uphold the Department of the Navy's policy of voluntary giving.
    a. Commands and organizations should review the regulations governing 
fundraising for NMCRS to determine which activities are permissible during 
the fund drive. Per reference (a), authorized ADFD fundraising activities in 
support of NMCRS include, but are not limited to command-sponsored raffles, 
lotteries, bake sales, car washes, or bowling tournaments. Fundraising events 
must be conducted on Department of Defense owned or leased property. If not, 
the event loses its "By Our Own, For Our Own" designation and cannot be 
command -endorsed. Commands and organizations are also strongly encouraged to 
communicate the benefits of NMCRS and its programs by achieving
100 percent meaningful contact through speeches, meetings, and videos, both 
in person and shared on social media. Limited appropriated fund support is 
permissible for kick-off events, award ceremonies, and other non-solicitation 
events to build support.
    b. References (a) through (c) prohibit any coercive activities counter to 
the policy of voluntary giving, such as setting unit- level dollar goals or 
participation goals. Any action, or perceived action, that does not allow 
Service members to have free choice to give, or not to give, or any action, 
or perceived action that Service members do not have a free choice to 
publicize their gifts or keep them confidential are prohibited. The following 
fundraising activities are also prohibited: selling civilian clothes 
privileges or special liberty, raffling government parking spaces, sponsoring 
casino-like games of chance, soliciting civilian or contractor personnel, or 
soliciting outside of the federal workplace. Civilian or contractor personnel 
are allowed to support the ADFD through online donations and participating in 
fundraisers, but may not be solicited to do so.
    c. Unit coordinators for the ADFD in support of NMCRS should consult 
their JAG or ethics counselor for further guidance regarding specific 
questions.

6. Navy-Marine Corps team, your steadfast support empowers our warfighting 
team to remain focused on what we do: deterring aggression, defending our 
national security interests and preserving our way of life. Thank you for all 
that you do.

7. Released by Admiral Kilby, Acting Chief of Naval Operations.//
