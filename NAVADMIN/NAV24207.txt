RMKS/1.  EVERYONE IS A CYBERSECURITY WARRIOR.  Today's interconnected world 
requires the vigilance and proactive engagement of every member of our 
Navy.  As we navigate the complexities of the digital age, it is an all hands 
endeavor to embrace the mindset that everyone is a cybersecurity warrior. 
 
2.  This October marks the 20th anniversary of Cybersecurity Awareness 
Month.  On March 20, 2024, and as directed in the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, DoD established the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy (ASD(CP)) and the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy (OASD(CP)), signaling the 
ever growing importance of cybersecurity.  We must continue to get better and 
maintain a steadfast focus on Cybersecurity.  The ASD(CP) is now the senior 
official responsible for overall supervision of DoD policy for cyber 
operations. 
 
3.  You are a Cybersecurity warrior:  Every Sailor, Navy federal employee, 
and contractor has a role to play in cybersecurity.  Simple actions such as 
using strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and reporting 
suspicious activities can significantly enhance our collective security. 
Leaders at all levels must prioritize cybersecurity and foster a 
cybersecurity culture.  This effort includes adding cybersecurity into every 
decision briefing, promoting best practices, and ensuring that cybersecurity 
is integrated into all aspects of operations.  We must conduct regular 
assessments, audits, and updates to cybersecurity protocols and practices to 
strengthen our defenses and deter threats. 
 
4.  Take action:  Stay informed by keeping abreast of the latest 
cybersecurity threats and asking questions.  Actively engage in cybersecurity 
training and stay updated on cybersecurity policies.  Adopt good 
cybersecurity practices and encourage others to do the same.  Recognize 
personnel who demonstrate exceptional cybersecurity practices. 
 
5.  Throughout the month of October, we will highlight our efforts to improve 
cybersecurity with specific focus areas each week.  These messages will help 
highlight how all hands must help us win in the cyber domain. 
 
6.  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility that demands the active 
participation of every member of our Navy.  Embracing the mindset that we are 
a Navy of cybersecurity warriors strengthens our defenses and ensures the 
resiliency of our networks and information.  Navy needs your commitment to 
win this vital battle!
