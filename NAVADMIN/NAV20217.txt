RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE UPDATES THE U.S. NAVY COVID-19 STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL 
GUIDANCE VERSION 2.0 ISSUED IN REF (A).  REF (A) IS CANCELLED.  THIS UPDATE 
INCORPORATES UPDATED CDC RETURN TO WORK GUIDANCE IN SECTION 7.D AS EVALUATED 
AND RECOMMENDED BY THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER (NMCPHC).
TO INCREASE PROBABILITY OF A COVID-FREE MISSION READY CREW, UNITS WILL ADHERE 
TO THE FOLLOWING STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE.  THESE DATA DRIVEN RISK 
MITIGATION MEASURES PROVIDE COMMANDERS THE TOOLS TO PREVENT AND WHEN 
NECESSARY  CONTAIN COVID-19 IMPACT TO SAFELY AND CONFIDENTLY REMAIN ON 
MISSION. FLEET, TYCOM, AND OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ISSUE MORE SPECIFIC 
GUIDANCE TO UNITS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.
THIS GUIDANCE BUILDS ON REFS (B) AND (C) WHILE INCORPORATING GUIDANCE FROM 
REFS (D) THROUGH (H). IT WILL GUIDE INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT HEALTH PROTECTION, 
PRESERVE OPERATIONAL READINESS, AND PROTECT SHIPMATES, INSTALLATIONS, AND 
COMMUNITIES FROM COVID-19 TRANSMISSION.  ALTHOUGH BIASED TOWARD THE SHIPBOARD 
ENVIRONMENT, THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO ALL PERSONNEL AND UNITS DEPLOYING TO 
AND FROM HOMEPORT (ORIGINATING UNIT LOCATION FOR RESERVE PERSONNEL).  IT DOES 
NOT APPLY TO ROUTINE TRAVEL (E.G. PCS, TDY, TAD) UNLESS THE TRAVELER IS A 
DEPLOYING INDIVIDUAL OR IS ASSIGNED TO OR WILL BE WORKING ABOARD AN 
OPERATIONAL UNIT. ADHERENCE TO THIS STANDARDIZED GUIDANCE INCLUDES ACCOUNTING 
FOR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS PER 
PARAGRAPH 9. EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NECESSITATE WAIVERS TO THIS 
GUIDANCE TO MEET EMERGENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
THE NAVAL COMPONENT COMMANDER (NCC) IS THE WAIVER AUTHORITY UNLESS OTHERWISE 
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED.

2.  DEFINITIONS.

2.A.  COVID-19 CASE: A MEMBER DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER BY ONE OF TWO 
METHODS:  1) A POSITIVE COVID-19 LABORATORY TEST, OR 2) ASSESSED AS PRESUMED 
POSITIVE PER THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST
(CSTE) CRITERIA FOR A PROBABLE CASE.

2.B.  PATIENT (OR PERSON) UNDER INVESTIGATION (PUI): AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SIGNS 
OR SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 WHO HAS A TEST RESULT PENDING OR WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TESTED HAD A TEST BEEN AVAILABLE.  MEMBERS ARE NO LONGER A PUI WHEN THEY:
A) RECEIVE A NEGATIVE COVID-19 LAB TEST RESULT; OR, B) HAVE MET ALL CRITERIA 
FOR RETURN TO WORK IN PARAGRAPH 7.D.  ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED 
DUE TO CLOSE CONTACT WITH A COVID POSITIVE MEMBER ARE NOT CLASSIFIED PUI.
ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS BEING TESTED FOR COVID-19 ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUIS 
WHILE AWAITING TEST RESULTS.

2.C.  HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL: THOSE INDIVIDUALS, DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL 
PROVIDER, THAT MEET THE CDC CRITERIA FOR INCREASED RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS 
FROM COVID-19 AVAILABLE AT: HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/NEED-
EXTRA-PRECAUTIONS/PEOPLE-AT-HIGHER-RISK.HTML 
THIS LIST EVOLVES AS KNOWLEDGE OF COVID-19 GROWS AND SHOULD BE CHECKED FREQUENTLY.

2.D.  CLOSE CONTACT:  INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS BEING WITHIN APPROXIMATELY
6 FEET (2 METERS) OF A COVID-19 CASE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME
(>15 MINUTES).  CLOSE CONTACT CAN OCCUR WHILE CARING FOR, LIVING WITH, 
VISITING, WORKING WITH, OR SHARING A DENSELY POPULATED SPACE WITH A
COVID-19 CASE.  CLOSE CONTACT CAN ALSO BE ESTABLISHED VIA DIRECT CONTACT 
(E.G. BEING COUGHED OR SNEEZED UPON BY A COVID-19 CASE).  DETERMINATION OF 
CLOSE CONTACT PRESUMES THE INTERACTION TRANSPIRED DURING THE COVID-19 CASES 
POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS PERIOD CURRENTLY DEFINED AS 48 HOURS PRIOR TO SYMPTOM 
ONSET (OR FIRST POSITIVE TEST IF ASYMPTOMATIC) TO THE TIME THE COVID-19 CASE 
IS PLACED IN ISOLATION.  SOME EXAMPLES SPECIFIC TO THE SHIPBOARD ENVIRONMENT
INCLUDE: A) INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COVID-19 CASES BERTHING AREA ASSIGNED AN 
ADJACENT RACK INCLUDING DIRECTLY ACROSS A NARROW AISLE; B) PROLONGED 
INTERACTION WITHIN RELATIVELY CONFINED SPACES INTERNAL TO THE SHIP (E.G. WORK 
SPACE, GALLEY, GYM, SMOKING DECK, CHAPEL, ETC.).

2.E.  MEDICAL SCREENING:  COVID-19 MEDICAL SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE 
EVALUATION FOR BOTH TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL SYMPTOMS. TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF COVID-
19 INCLUDE:
COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING, FEVER, CHILLS, MUSCLE 
PAIN, GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS, AND RECENT LOSS OF TASTE OR SMELL.  ATYPICAL 
SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: SORE THROAT, RHINORRHEA 
(RUNNY NOSE), NASAL CONGESTION, NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, HEADACHE, INCREASED 
CONFUSION, DIZZINESS, AND MALAISE. A COMPLETE LIST OF COVID-19 SYMPTOMS CAN 
BE FOUND AT:
HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/SYMPTOMS-TESTING/SYMPTOMS.HTML.

2.F.  SELF-MONITORING. PER THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION 
(CDC), SELF-MONITORING INCLUDES ASSESSING ONSET OF FEVER BY TAKING ONES 
TEMPERATURE TWICE A DAY AND REMAINING ALERT FOR SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH 
COVID-19.  CDC DEFINES FEVER AS TEMPERATURE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 100.4 F 
(38C) DEGREES.  INDIVIDUALS THAT DEVELOP FEVER, COUGH, OR BREATHING DIFFICULTY 
OR RECENT LOSS OF TASTE OR SMELL SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SELF-ISOLATE, LIMIT CONTACT 
WITH OTHERS, AND SEEK ADVICE BY TELEPHONE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE IF 
FURTHER MEDICAL EVALUATION IS REQUIRED.

2.G.  RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT (ROM).  GENERAL DOD TERM FOR LIMITING PERSONAL 
INTERACTION TO REDUCE RISK TO THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF A BROADER 
COHORT. ROM IS USED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF INDIVIDUALS ENCOUNTERING COVID-19 
CONTAGIOUS INDIVIDUALS, AND TO PREVENT PERSONNEL WHO HAVE BEEN IN A HIGHER 
RISK AREA FROM POTENTIALLY INFECTING OTHERS. ROM INCLUDES ISOLATION, 
QUARANTINE AND ROM-SEQUESTER.

2.G.1.  ISOLATION: MEDICAL TERM FOR THE STRICT SEPARATION OF PERSONNEL FROM 
OTHERS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL COVID-19 SYMPTOMS OR A POSITIVE
COVID-19 TEST.

2.G.2.  QUARANTINE: MEDICAL TERM FOR SEPARATING ASYMPTOMATIC PERSONNEL FROM 
THOSE PEOPLE REASONABLY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A COMMUNICABLE 
DISEASE, TO PREVENT THE POSSIBLE SPREAD OF THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE.  FOR THE 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PERSONNEL WITH NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS WHO HAVE RECENTLY 
RETURNED FROM A HIGHER RISK LOCATION OR HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH A KNOWN COVID-
19 POSITIVE PATIENT SHOULD BE QUARANTINED. THE QUARANTINE PERIOD IS 14 DAYS.

2.G.3.  ROM-SEQUESTER: U.S. NAVY TERM FOR PREEMPTIVE SEPARATION OF FORCES TO 
REDUCE RISK OF INFECTION WHILE ESTABLISHING A COVID-FREE BUBBLE. ROM-
SEQUESTER CAN BE CONDUCTED ONBOARD SHIP, IN CONTRACTED FACILITIES, OR IN 
PERSONAL RESIDENCE DEPENDENT ON UNIT-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS.  DURING ROM-
SEQUESTER, INTERACTION WITH INDIVIDUALS TRAVELING OUTSIDE OF THE ROM-
SEQUESTER LOCATION MUST BE MINIMIZED. INTERACTION WITHIN ROM-SEQUESTER 
LOCATION IS RESTRICTED TO BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD DELIVERY.

2.H.  BUBBLE.  U.S. NAVY TERM FOR INDIVIDUALS, UNITS OR INSTALLATIONS THAT 
HAVE ESTABLISHED LOW PROBABILITY OF COVID-19 INFECTION. A CREW THAT HAS BEEN 
UNDERWAY, OR ROM-SEQUESTERED AT THE PIER, FOR GREATER THAN 14 DAYS WITHOUT 
COVID-19 POSITIVE PERSONNEL AND NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS IS WITHIN A BUBBLE.

2.I.  BUBBLE TO BUBBLE TRANSFER (B2BT). U.S. NAVY TERM FOR MOVEMENT OF UNITS 
OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE BUBBLE TO ANOTHER VIA CONTROLLED MEANS.  A WIDE VARIETY 
OF MODES/MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION CAN BE USED FOR B2BT.  THE KEY FACTOR IS 
THAT THE EVOLUTION IS CLOSELY CONTROLLED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF COVID-19 
EXPOSURE TO BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND UNITS DURING TRANSFER.

3.  MINIMUM ACTION REQUIRED PRIOR TO DEPLOYED OPERATIONS.

3.A.  MANDATORY MEDICAL SCREENING BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER.

3.A.1.  PRE-DEPLOYMENT SCREENING FOR ALL PERSONNEL WILL CONSIST OF AN 
ASSESSMENT OF COVID-19 EXPOSURE HISTORY, A TEMPERATURE CHECK, A CHECK FOR 
COVID-19 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS LISTED IN PARA 2.E. FOR MILITARY MEMBERS, IT WILL 
ALSO INCLUDE A REVIEW OF ANY PAST COVID-19 TESTING AND A THOROUGH EVALUATION 
OF THE MEMBERS RISK FACTORS FOR SEVERE ILLNESS FROM COVID-19.

3.A.2.  DEPLOYMENT OF HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE UNCOMMON AND GUIDED BY 
MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOUND IN REF (H).  DECISIONS MUST BE MADE, AT A 
MINIMUM, BY THE ISIC.  MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND WILL MEDICALLY SCREEN CIVIL 
SERVICE AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL FOR DEPLOYMENT ON MSC VESSELS IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH EXISTING MSC INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTRACTS.

3.B.  CONDUCT A MINIMUM 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT. DEPENDING 
ON SCHEDULE AND PLANNED OPERATIONS, THE NCC WILL DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER 
IS WARRANTED PRIOR TO INTEGRATED PHASE.

3.B.1.  CONDUCT ENHANCED DAILY PERSONNEL MEDICAL SCREENING (QUESTIONNAIRE / 
TEMPERATURE CHECKS).

3.B.2.  ALL PERSONNEL DEPLOYING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WILL UNDERGO A 14-
DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.  IF TRAVELING OCONUS AND THE HOST 
NATION REQUIRES 14-DAY IN-COUNTRY ROM, CONUS PRE-DEPLOYMENT ROM-SEQUESTER IS 
NOT REQUIRED UNLESS THE HOST NATION EXPLICITLY MANDATES BOTH.

3.B.3.  ACCEPTABLE ROM-SEQUESTER FACILITIES ARE:  SHIP BERTHING, LIVING 
BARGE, INDIVIDUAL BARRACKS/HOTEL ROOMS, OR PERSONAL RESIDENCE (WITH LIMITED 
CONTACT WITH OTHER RESIDENTS).  EACH HAS PROS AND CONS THAT MUST BE WEIGHED 
AGAINST UNIT-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND RISK.  MINIMIZING CONTACT WITH OTHERS 
AND FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH MITIGATION MEASURES IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL 
ROM-SEQUESTER.

3.B.4.  PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND SANITIZE MORE FREQUENTLY WHILE 
MANNING ESSENTIAL WATCH STATIONS, COMPLETING REQUIRED MAINTENANCE, AND 
CONDUCTING REQUIRED UNDERWAY PREPARATION (LOGISTICS, TRAINING, ETC.).

3.B.5.  DEVELOP OPERATIONAL BENCH FOR REDLINE PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN MISSION 
ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS (NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, BRIDGE, COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER, 
CWC WATCHES, MEDICAL PROVIDERS, ETC.).

3.C.  DEPLOYING UNITS WILL TEST/ROM-SEQUESTER PER FLEET APPROVED COMMUNITY 
CONOPS. THESE CONOPS WERE REVIEWED BY BUMED FOR THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC 
EFFICACY AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO ENSURE STANDARDIZATION AND CONSISTENCY 
ACROSS THE FORCE. TESTING IS THE BEST WAY TO IDENTIFY ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 
POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, TESTING DOES NOT GUARANTEE A COVID-FREE 
DEPLOYING UNIT DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR FALSE NEGATIVE TESTS. USE OPERATIONAL 
UNIT RETURN TO WORK (RTW) GUIDANCE, PARA. 7.D.1. TO CLEAR COVID POSITIVE 
TESTS.

3.D.  SHIP RIDERS (E.G. CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.), 
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS ASSISTING COMMANDS PRIOR TO BUBBLE 
ESTABLISHMENT WILL ADHERE TO LOCAL FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS 
(DAILY COVID-19 SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, PHYSICAL 
DISTANCING, PPE, RESTRICTED SHIPBOARD MOVEMENT, SANITIZATION, ETC.).
WHEN INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT TO SEQUENTIAL  COMMANDS, IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO 
ROM-SEQUESTER TEAMS, USE B2BT, AND/OR TEST PERIODICALLY.

3.E.  SHIP RIDERS (E.G. CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.), 
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS PENETRATING AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE 
WILL COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO EMBARKING. USE OPERATIONAL UNIT 
RTW GUIDANCE TO CLEAR COVID POSITIVE TESTS, PARA. 7.D.1.  MITIGATION PLANS TO 
PENETRATE AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE WITHOUT A 14 DAY ROM-SEQUESTER DUE TO 
EMERGENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC.

4.  MINIMUM REQUIRED ACTION FOR MAINTENANCE, BASIC, ADVANCED/INTEGRATED, AND 
SUSTAINMENT PHASES.

4.A.  MAINTENANCE PHASE.  AGGRESSIVE AWARENESS, DIAGNOSIS, AND CONTACT 
TRACING ARE CRITICAL TO COMBAT COVID-19. COMMANDERS MUST REMAIN ALERT TO THE 
REALITY SOME SAILORS CARRYING COVID-19 MAY BE ASYMPTOMATIC AND MITIGATE RISKS 
ACCORDINGLY. THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM MEASURES APPLY:

4.A.1.  FOLLOW LOCAL HPCON STATUS AND FHP MEASURES.  EMPHASIZE PERSONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY (CLOTH FACE COVERINGS, PHYSICAL DISTANCING, AVOID LOCAL AREAS 
WITH HIGH POPULATION DENSITY, SELF-MONITOR, ETC.).  REPORT AND ISOLATE 
PERSONNEL WITH COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. SCREEN ALL PERSONNEL AND VISITORS DAILY AT 
WORK, TO INCLUDE TEMPERATURE CHECKS.  CLEAN AND DISINFECT SPACES DAILY IAW 
NAVSEA CLEANING GUIDANCE. CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COVID-19 ORM MEASURES FOR MAJOR 
EVENTS (E.G. SHIPBOARD DRILLS).

4.A.2.  SUPPORT ORGANIZATION COMMANDERS (E.G. SHIPYARD PERSONNEL, CONTRACT 
SUPPORT, TRAINING TEAMS, ETC.), SHOULD CONSIDER CURRENT HPCON, CDC THREAT 
LEVEL, METHOD/MODE OF TRAVEL, ETC. WHEN ASSESSING RISK AND DETERMINING IF 
ROM- SEQUESTER IS WARRANTED. FOR EXAMPLE, A TEAM OF SHIPYARD WORKERS MOVING 
FROM AN AREA WITH LOW COVID CASES TO AN AREA OF LOW, MEDIUM OR HIGH COVID 
CASES MIGHT NOT WARRANT ROM-SEQUESTER UNLESS COMPELLED BY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES 
SUCH AS TRAVEL THROUGH A HIGH RISK AIRPORT. REGARDLESS, VISITORS SHOULD 
FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE 
CHECKS, PHYSICAL DISTANCING, PPE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS AS 
SHIPS FORCE.

4.A.3  AIRCRAFT SQUADRON COMMANDERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE CURRENT RISK LEVEL 
PER PARAGRAPH 4.A.2 TO DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER IS REQUIRED FOR TRAINING 
DETACHMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SAILOR MAY USE A PERSONAL VEHICLE TO DRIVE FROM 
MILITARY BASE TO MILITARY BASE WITH INFREQUENT GAS OR FOOD STOPS TO MAINTAIN 
A MODIFIED BUBBLE.  REGARDLESS, TRAVELERS SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY 
SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, PHYSICAL 
DISTANCING, PPE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS DICTATED BY LOCAL 
HPCON CONDITIONS.

4.B.  BASIC PHASE.  INCLUDES SAME MEASURES AS THE MAINTENANCE PHASE, PLUS:

4.B.1.  UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WITH ABILITY TO GET MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY 
(MTF) SUPPORTWITHIN 72 HOURS.  SCREEN HIGH RISK SAILORS AND ENSURE PPE 
LOADOUT MEETS FLEET GUIDANCE.  FOLLOW PLATFORM SPECIFIC COVID-19 CONOPS AND 
SOPS.

4.B.2. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WHEN MTF SUPPORT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN 72 
HOURS. SAME MEASURES AS LOCAL OPERATIONS, PLUS, IAW FLEET COMMANDER GUIDANCE, 
CONSIDER MEDICAL TEAM AUGMENT, MEDEVAC AUGMENT/HELO CAPABILITY, AND SHIPBOARD 
TESTING CAPABILITY.

4.C.  ADVANCED AND INTEGRATED PHASES. SAME MEASURES AS MAINTENANCE AND BASIC 
PHASES, PLUS:

4.C.1.  IF DEPLOYING IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTEGRATED PHASE (I.E., COMPTUEX(C2X)) 
OR PRE-OVERSEAS MOVEMENT EVALUATION (POMEVAL), FOLLOW GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH 
3.

4.D.  SUSTAINMENT PHASE.

4.D.1.  UNDERWAY:  MAINTAIN BUBBLE PER PARAGRAPH 3.E.

4.D.2.  PIER-SIDE: FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENT, FOLLOW BASIC PHASE GUIDANCE.
OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ELECT TO SHIFT TO PARAGRAPH 3 GUIDANCE DEPENDING 
ON LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.

4.E.  FOR SHORE BASED COMMANDS SENDING PERSONNEL TO AFLOAT UNITS, FOLLOW THE 
GUIDANCE THAT APPLIES TO THE PHASE OF THE RECEIVING UNIT.  FOR ALL PERSONNEL 
TRAVELING TO SHORE COMMANDS (E.G. SCHOOLS, TDY, ETC.), FOLLOW MAINTENANCE 
PHASE CRITERIA OF PARA 4.A.

4.F.  FOR ALL PHASES, DISCIPLINED INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH 
PROTECTION MEASURES ARE THE BEDROCK OF RISK REDUCTION AND RISK MITIGATION.
COVID MITIGATION PROTOCOL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, SHOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL 
SUPPORT FOR HIGH RISK PERSONNEL.  COMMANDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING, 
MANAGING, OVERSEEING AND IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOLS FOR THEIR UNITS. INDIVIDUALS 
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THOSE PROTOCOLS.

5.  DUE TO THE UNIQUE NATURE OF FORWARD DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES (FDNF) AND 
THEIR HOST NATION RELATIONSHIP, NCCS WILL DEFINE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR 
FDNF UNITS USING PARAGRAPH 3 AND 4 AS THE BASIS.

6.  COMMANDERS MAY NEED TO EXEMPT AIRCREW AND AIRCRAFT MAINTAINERS FROM THIS 
GUIDANCE TO MEET EMERGENT OPERATIONAL OR NATOPS CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS. ROBUST 
RISK MITIGATION IS REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE COVID THREATS TO EXISTING BUBBLES.
MITIGATION PLANS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC.

7.  REQUIRED ACTION WHEN MILITARY, CIVILIAN, OR CONTRACTOR EXHIBITS SIGNS OR 
SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INFECTION.

7.A.  ISOLATE, MEDICALLY SCREEN AND DESIGNATE AS PUI. RESTRICT CONTACT AND 
PROTECT THE OPERATIONAL BENCH IF APPLICABLE.

7.A.1.  IF ISOLATED ABOARD SHIP, USE SMALL BERTHING AREAS (E.G. STATEROOMS, 
PREFERABLY WITH HEADS) FOR SEPARATION.  WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD ISOLATION 
CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER TRANSFERRING PUIS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING 
CAPACITY OR ASHORE, IF FEASIBLE AND MISSION ALLOWS.

7.A.2.  IF ISOLATED ASHORE, PROVIDE NECESSARY MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL 
CLINICALLY IMPROVED.

7.B.  IDENTIFY, QUARANTINE, AND MEDICALLY SCREEN CLOSE CONTACTS OF COVID-19 
CASES AND SYMPTOMATIC PUIS AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPHS 2.A AND 2.B.  MINIMUM 
SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE COVID-19 QUESTIONNAIRE TO ASSESS RISK TO EXPOSURE, 
TEMPERATURE CHECK, AND VISUAL CHECK FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OUTLINED BY THE 
CDC.
WHEN LOCAL TESTING CAPACITY AND SUPPLIES ALLOW, TESTING IS RECOMMENDED FOR 
ALL CLOSE CONTACTS OF CONFIRMED OR PROBABLE COVID-19 PATIENTS. WHEN ADEQUATE 
SHIPBOARD QUARANTINE CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER TRANSFERRING CLOSE 
CONTACTS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING CAPACITY OR ASHORE, IF FEASIBLE AND MISSION 
ALLOWS.

7.B.1  CLOSE CONTACTS THAT TEST POSITIVE TRANSITION TO AND ARE MANAGED BY
COVID-19 CASE PROTOCOL.  CLOSE CONTACTS THAT CANNOT BE TESTED MUST QUARANTINE 
FOR 14 DAYS FROM LAST CLOSE CONTACT ENCOUNTER.

7.B.2   ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED DUE TO CLOSE
CONTACT ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUI, PER PARAGRAPH 2.B.

7.B.3.  IF CLOSE CONTACT BECOMES SYMPTOMATIC - FOLLOW PUI PROTOCOL.

7.C.  PROTOCOL FOR PUI.

7.C.1  TEST PUI IF POSSIBLE.

7.C.2.  IF TEST RESULT POSITIVE - CONTINUE ISOLATION AND TREAT.

7.C.3  IF TEST RESULT NEGATIVE - PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL CLINICALLY 
IMPROVED.

7.C.4  IF TEST RESULT NEGATIVE AND PUI DOES NOT IMPROVE - ISOLATE AND FOLLOW 
PARAGRAPH 7.D.

7.C.5  IF NO TEST PERFORMED - MEDICALLY SCREEN TWICE A DAY AT A MINIMUM AND, 
IF SYMPTOMS WORSEN, CONSULT MEDICAL AUTHORITIES REGARDING TRANSFER TO MEDICAL 
TREATMENT FACILITY.

7.D.  RETURN TO WORK (RTW) GUIDANCE FOR COVID-19 CASES.

7.D.1.  OPERATIONAL UNITS.  COVID-19 CASES MUST MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING 
CRITERIA TO RTW:  (1) AT LEAST 24 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE RESOLUTION OF FEVER 
WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING MEDICATION, (2) PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT IN 
OTHER COVID-19 SYMPTOMS AS DETERMINED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER, AND (3) AT LEAST
14 DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE SYMPTOMS FIRST APPEARED OR SINCE THE DATE OF 
THE FIRST POSITIVE RT-PCR TEST IF ASYMPTOMATIC.

7.D.2.  ALL OTHER UNITS AND STAFFS.  COVID-19 CASES MUST MEET ALL OF THE 
FOLLOWING CRITERIA TO RTW:  (1) AT LEAST 24 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE 
RESOLUTION OF FEVER WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING MEDICATION (2) 
IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER
COVID-19 SYMPTOMS, AND (3) AT LEAST 10 DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE SYMPTOMS 
FIRST APPEARED OR RT-PCR TEST DATE IF ASYMPTOMATIC.

7.D.3.  FOR SEVERE CASES WHERE INDIVIDUALS REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION, EXTEND 
THE DURATION OF ISOLATION SUCH THAT RTW IS NO EARLIER THAN DAY 21 (20 DAYS 
SINCE SYMPTOM ONSET) AS SOME PERSONS WITH SEVERE COVID-19 ILLNESS MAY REMAIN 
INFECTIOUS FOR SLIGHTLY LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.

7.D.4.  RETURN TO EXERCISE.  THE RTW GUIDANCE IN 7.D.1 THROUGH 7.D.3 IS BASED 
ON RESOLUTION OF INFECTIVITY.  BASED ON SEVERITY OF ILLNESS, SOME PERSONNEL 
MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME TO GRADUALLY RETURN TO INTENSE EXERCISE, IF 
OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE.  REF (H) CONTAINS RETURN TO EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS.

7.D.5.  NCC MAY ELECT TO TREAT CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ENABLERS, SUCH AS 
INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION TEAMS, AS OPERATIONAL UNITS, PARA. 7.D.1.

7.D.6.  A TEST BASED STRATEGY IS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED TO DETERMINE RTW 
BECAUSE IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES IT RESULTS IN IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO CONTINUE 
TO SHED DETECTABLE SARS-COV-2 RNA BUT ARE NO LONGER INFECTIOUS.  A 
COMBINATION OF BOTH SYMPTOM RESOLUTION AND TESTING CRITERIA IS NOT 
RECOMMENDED AS IT WILL LIKELY EXTEND RTW WITH NO CORRESPONDING DECREASE OF 
INFECTION TRANSMISSION.

7.E.  PERSONNEL MAY CONTINUE TO TEST POSITIVE FOR UP TO THREE MONTHS DUE TO 
THE PRESENCEOF PERSISTENT NON-INFECTIOUS VIRAL FRAGMENTS.  THEREFORE, THEY 
ARE EXEMPT FROM ANY REQUIRED TESTING PROTOCOL FOR THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING ANY 
POSITIVE TEST.  INDIVIDUALS THAT EXHIBIT NEW OR PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS DURING 
THAT THREE MONTH PERIOD SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER.
STUDIES HAVE NOT FOUND EVIDENCE THAT CLINICALLY RECOVERED PERSONS WITH 
PERSISTENCE OF VIRAL RNA HAVE TRANSMITTED COVID-19 TO OTHERS.

7.F.  VIRAL CULTURE: VIRAL CULTURE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A PRIMARY OR STAND-
ALONE RETURN TO WORK CRITERIA. HOWEVER, IF A VIRAL CULTURE HAS BEEN OBTAINED 
DURING A COVID CASE CLINICAL EVALUATION, RESULTS MAY BE USED AS SUPPLEMENTAL 
CRITERIA FOR PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING CASES.

7.G.  COMMAND AND MEMBER NOTIFICATION: THE INDIVIDUAL SICK SLIP (DD FORM 689) 
MUST BE USED TO NOTIFY BOTH THE MEMBER AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF ANY TEST-
CONFIRMED OR PRESUMPTIVE COVID ILLNESS, WHETHER SYMPTOMATIC OR NOT.
SECTION 11 (DISPOSITION) AND SECTION 12 (REMARKS) MUST CLEARLY INDICATE THE 
MEDICALLY-RECOMMENDED DISPOSITION, FOLLOW UP, AND QUARANTINE/ISOLATION 
REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS GUIDANCE. THE SICK SLIP MUST ALSO BE 
USED TO NOTIFY ASYMPTOMATIC MEMBERS AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF ANY PUI OR 
CLOSE CONTACT, QUARANTINE, OR ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS 
GUIDANCE. BEGINNING AND ENDING DATES OF THE QUARANTINE/ISOLATION PERIOD, 
SYMPTOM-FREE REQUIREMENTS, AND MEDICAL FOLLOW UP MUST BE CLEARLY INDICATED IN 
SECTION 12 (REMARKS).

8.  POST-DEPLOYMENT/REDEPLOYMENT.

8.A.  MILITARY MEMBERS RETURNING TO CONUS FROM DEPLOYMENT WILL COMPLETE A 14-
DAY ROM AT HOME STATION.  MEMBERS RETURNING VIA SHIP OR MILAIR WITH NO ACTIVE 
COVID-19 CASES WITHIN THEIR UNIT IN THE LAST 14 DAYS, MAY COUNT TRANSIT TIME 
(BEGINNING ON THE DAY OF DEPARTURE FROM THE LAST PORT OR
AIRFIELD) TOWARD THE ROM REQUIREMENT.  SERVICE MEMBERS ON POST-DEPLOYMENT ROM 
ARE RESTRICTED TO THEIR PERSONAL RESIDENCE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE DOMICILE AND 
MUST LIMIT CLOSE CONTACTS.

8.B.  REDEPLOYING INDIVIDUALS MUST BE SCREENED AT THE ASSIGNED PLACE OF DUTY 
OR POINT OF EMBARKATION.  AT A MINIMUM, SCREENING WILL CONSIST OF
COVID-19 QUESTIONNAIRE, ASSESSMENT OF EXPOSURE HISTORY, TEMPERATURE CHECK, 
CHECK FOR COVID-19 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 2.E., AND REVIEW OF 
ANY PAST COVID-19 TESTING.

8.C.  AT THE COMPLETION OF DEPLOYMENT, ALL PERSONNEL WILL COMPLETE A POST-
DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DD FORM 2796) AND POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH 
REASSESSMENT (DD FORM 2900) IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF (F).

8.D.  ALL COVID-19 TESTING AND RESULTS WILL BE ENTERED IN A SERVICE MEMBERS 
MEDICAL RECORD.

9.  ADDITIONAL ROM AND MEDICAL SCREENING CONSIDERATIONS.

9.A.  COMMANDERS MUST ENSURE ROM AND MEDICAL SCREENING GUIDANCE GIVEN TO DOD 
CIVILIAN AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL CAN BE APPLIED CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE 
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND CONTRACT.  COMMANDERS SHOULD CONSIDER WEATHER AND 
SAFETY LEAVE AND TELEWORK AS OPTIONS TO FACILITATE DOD CIVILIAN COMPLETION OF 
ROM.  COMMANDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT THEIR SERVICING STAFF JUDGE 
ADVOCATES, OGC LEGAL COUNSEL, AND/OR HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICE FOR CASE-SPECIFIC 
GUIDANCE.

9.B.  THIS GUIDANCE DOES NOT ALTER, MODIFY, OR CHANGE THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF ANY DOD CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER DOD 
CONTRACT.  ONLY WARRANTED OFFICERS MAY AGREE TO PAY ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
DOD CONTRACTOR ROM.
