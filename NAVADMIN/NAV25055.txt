RMKS/1.  Pursuant to references (a) through (c), this NAVADMIN cancels 
references (d) and (e), and establishes voluntary separation procedures for 
Service Members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit 
symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria in line with references (a) 
through (c).
    a.  Effective immediately, all exceptions to policy allowing a member to 
conform to standards associated with a sex different from their 
identification in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) 
approved in accordance with reference (d) are revoked and no further 
exceptions will be approved.  Gender marker change requests previously 
submitted under references (d) and (e), will no longer be accepted or 
processed by MyNavy Career Center (MNCC).
    b.  Navy and Marine Corps personnel will take no action to identify 
Service Members, pursuant to references (a) and (b), to include the use of 
medical records, periodic health assessments, ad hoc physical assessments, or 
any other diagnostic mechanism, unless otherwise directed by an appropriate 
official in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and 
Readiness.  Nothing in this paragraph prevents commanders from taking 
appropriate action in support of Service Members who request to voluntarily 
separate in accordance with paragraph 3 below.
    c.  Cross-sex hormone therapy that began prior to the issuance of 
reference (f) will be continued for the duration of the Service Member's time 
in service if recommended by a DoD health care provider.
    d.  Service Members may consult with a Department of Defense health care 
provider concerning a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and receive mental health 
counseling for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.

2.  Voluntary Separation Request Deadline.  Active-Duty and Reserve Service 
Members that meet the criteria outlined in reference (a) may request 
voluntary separation or, for those eligible, retirement no later than (NLT) 
2359Y (UTC-12:00), Friday, 28 March 2025.
    a.  Service Members that meet the eligibility requirements for Voluntary 
Separation Pay (VSP) in line with reference (g) may receive VSP at a rate 
that is twice the amount of involuntary separation pay for which the Service 
Member would have been eligible in line with reference (h).
        (1) VSP is not payable to Service Members with less than 6 Years of 
Service (YOS) or immediately eligible for retired pay upon separation.
        (2) VSP is not payable to the Reserve Component.
        (3) In line with reference (c), Service Members who receive VSP will 
not be required to serve in the Ready Reserve.
    b.  Service Members requesting voluntary separation in line with 
reference (c) are not required to pay back any bonus or incentive pays 
received where the required obligation has not been met.
    c.  Service Members identified after 2359Y, 28 March 2025 who meet the 
criteria outlined in section 4.4 of reference (a) and who have not submitted 
a voluntary separation or retirement request will be subject to involuntary 
separation and will no longer be eligible for the benefits outlined in 
paragraphs 2.a and 2.b and may be required to pay back any bonus or incentive 
pays received where the required obligation has not been met.  Procedures for 
involuntary separation will be promulgated via future guidance.

3.  Voluntary Separation Process.  The process for requesting voluntary 
separation or retirement differs depending on rank, time in service, and 
active or reserve status.  Requests for voluntary separation or retirement 
will be submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel (DCNP) via the 
applicable process as outlined below.
For all submissions via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS), 
Service Members who receive system notifications that they are ineligible for 
the type of retirement or separation they are requesting, but are eligible in 
line with this NAVADMIN, should disregard the notifications and request 
waivers for all constraining conditions (e.g. Time in Grade (TIG)).
    a.  The Service Member's Commanding Officer (CO) for Active Duty or, for 
Selected Reservists (SELRES), the Service Member's Navy Reserve Activity 
(NRA) CO, is required to expeditiously forward the request to DCNP with an 
endorsement.
    b.  All requests must include an affidavit in the form of a permanent 
NAVPERS 1070/613 signed by the Service Member and witnessed by a command 
representative with the statement:  "In line with OSD memos "Additional 
Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness" of 26 February 
2025, and "Clarifying Guidance on Military Excellence and Readiness" of 28 
February 2025, and ALNAV 023/25, I seek to voluntarily separate [or retire, 
as appropriate] from Naval Service.  I certify that I meet the criteria for 
this program as described in ALNAV 023/25 and understand this is an official 
statement under the meaning of Article 107 of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice.  I understand that my eligibility for this program may be verified 
via medical records, service records, and/or diagnosis by a medical provider, 
as determined by future guidance."  The signed NAVPERS 1070/613 shall be 
uploaded in each of the requisite systems outlined below for each separation 
or retirement request.
    c.  Service Members that have issues accessing or submitting their 
separation or retirement request via NSIPS may contact the NSIPS helpdesk 
using the contact information in section 9.b of this NAVADMIN.
    d.  After submitting the separation or retirement request, Service 
Members will email the NPC Point of Contact (POC) at molly.bergeron-

    a.  In addition to forwarding the separation or retirement request to 
DCNP via NPC, commands will verify that notification of the Service Member's 
voluntary separation, retirement, and/or placement on administrative absence 
or temporary duty is sent to the NPC POC at molly.bergeron-
conway7.mil@us.navy.mil and the SCCC at usn_navy_sccc@navy.mil.
    b.  Service Members who request separation will be placed in an 
administrative non-deployable status.  They will be assigned a "Category 3" 
Deployability Category code, identifying them as temporarily non-deployable, 
as described in reference (m).

8.  Administrative Absences.  In line with reference (a) and in line with 
reference (c), administrative absence is authorized for Active Duty and 
Reserve Service Members who elect voluntary separation when in the best 
interest of the unit and well-being of the Service Member.  Additionally, 
where rescission of an exception to policy will impact good order and 
discipline, the CO may consider placing the Service Member on administrative 
absence.  Administrative absence or temporary duty is not required but should 
be considered based on the criteria below.  In either case, commands will 
follow the procedures outlined in reference (n) or (o) as applicable.
    a.  Pursuant to reference (c), all Service Members with an approved 
exception to policy that is revoked pursuant to paragraph 1a above will be 
offered administrative absence status pending action on the member's 
separation request.
    b.  COs should consider the impact to good order and discipline within 
their unit, the well-being of the Service Member, and their ability to 
maintain effective oversight and support for the Service Member during the 
process.
    c.  COs will proactively communicate with the impacted Service Member, 
ensure they have accurate and up to date contact information, monitor their 
well-being, and keep the Service Member apprised of their status.
    d.  Service Members will receive full pay and benefits until their 
separation is complete.

9.  Points of Contact:
