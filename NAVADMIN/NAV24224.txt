RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the implementation of a tiered multiple for 
nuclear trained Sailors executing Zone B Selective Reenlistment Bonus 
(SRB).  Nuclear trained Sailors reenlisting in SRB Zone B who commit to 
return to sea following their shore tour will, receive a higher SRB multiple 
and higher contract limit. 
 
2.  Purpose.  Maintaining a strong and talented cadre of Second Sea Tour 
(SEA-2) Sailors is vital to maximizing the warfighting capabilities of the 
nuclear fleet.  This NAVADMIN creates a unique retention incentive for 
qualified, career-minded, nuclear trained Sailors who commit to return to 
sea. 
 
3.  Eligibility.  Nuclear trained Sailors must meet all requirements listed 
in references (a) and (b) for Zone B reenlistment and the following: 
    a.  Qualified propulsion plant watch supervisor or engineering watch 
supervisor (currently holding the N33Z NEC) 
    b.  Reenlist in SRB Zone B for a period of six years during their First 
Sea Tour (SEA-1); or earliest opportunity, if transferred from SEA-1 prior to 
six years of service. 
Forward any questions regarding reenlistment timing to Nuclear Enlisted 
Programs (OPNAV N133D). 
 
4.  Incentive.  These nuclear trained Sailors will be able to utilize a 10.5 
multiple for purposes of calculating their SRB Zone B bonus in line with 
reference (a).  Additionally, the following limits apply to these SRBs 
replacing those listed in reference (a):  (1) $40,000 per year of additional 
obligated service and (2) $160,000 per contract.  All other portions of 
reference (a) are applicable. 
 
5.  Execution.  The maximum award level >$100,000 or $40,000/year of active 
obligated service is not yet programed into Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS). 
Sailors seeking to take advantage of bonuses in excess of $100,000 should 
submit the bonus as normal in NSIPS.  Once the SRB pre-certification is 
approved, contact the SRB help desk at 901-874-3215 or 
mill_incen_pays.fct@navy.mil to recalculate the bonus for the correct amount. 
 
6.  Note.  Executing a six year SRB Zone B and committing to a SEA-2 tour 
does not preclude Sailors from re-enlisting in the enlisted supervisor 
retention pay Zone 1 in line with reference (b). 
 
7.  The point of contact is the Nuclear Enlisted Community Manager, OPNAV 
N133D, and can be reached at (703) 604-5491/DSN 664 or via e-mail at 
bullnuke@navy.mil.
