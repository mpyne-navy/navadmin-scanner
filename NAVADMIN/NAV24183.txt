RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces guidance for the administration of the January 2025 (Cycle 
266) E7 Navy-Wide Advancement Examination (NWAE) for Active Duty and Training and 
Administration of the Reserves (TAR) Sailors. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet (EAW) is the 
authoritative source of data used to determine Cycle 266 E7 eligibility.  Commands are to 
accurately validate, complete, and finalize all EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS).  EAW discrepancies should be addressed via a Post-examination Administration 
Comment (PAC) process after worksheets are locked. 
 
3.  Cycle 266 timeline: 
    a.  30 November 2024:  Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam (PMK-EE) completion 
deadline. 
    b.  31 December 2024:  Enlisted Leaders Development (ELD) course completion deadline. 
    c.  16 January 2025:  Exam administration.  EAW will close one week after the exam date on the 
worksheet. 
    d.  Deviation from administration dates.  In line with reference (a), commands that require 
rescheduling of NWAE administration date (with valid reason) may request a deviation of NWAE 
administration from Navy Personnel Command, Enlisted Career Administration Division 
(PERS-803).  If authorized, administration will be completed by 31 January 2025. 
 
4.  Eligibility requirements are in line with reference (a), and the following information applies for 
Cycle 266: 
    a.  Terminal Eligibility Date:  1 January 2026. 
    b.  Time-in-Rate (TIR) date:  on or before 1 January 2023. 
    c.  Early Promote (EP) TIR waiver date:  on or before 1 January 2024.  E7 candidate TIR 
requirements for EP can be waived by one year with Commanding Officer (CO) or Officer-In-Charge 
(OIC) approval.  EAW must be created manually for all who receive EP waiver.  EP candidates are 
still bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR candidates. 
    d.  High Year Tenure (HYT).  In line with references (e) and (f), the HYT plus pilot program allows for 
Sailors to continue their Navy careers beyond the HYT limits.  References (e) and (f) should 
be read in their entirety.  In the EAW, the "HYT Exceeded" entry may reflect "Yes" - when applicable, 
select "Yes" for "HYT Waived." 
    e.  Security/Interim security clearance (if required).  Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, 
AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CWT, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, FCA, GM, 
HT, IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, RW, SB, SO, STG and YN, as well as all nuclear and 
submarine ratings.  All NWAE candidates must have applicable adjudication (top secret or secret) 
or CO/OIC interim clearance dated prior to 1 January 2025.  If clearance is revoked, an exam is not 
authorized until the discrepancy is corrected.  An eligibility determination of "No Determination 
Made" constitutes an unfavorable adjudication. 
    f.  Reporting Senior's Cumulative Average Performance Mark Average (RSCA PMA).  In line with 
reference (g), compute RSCA PMA for applicable E6 evaluations dated from 1 January 2022 to 31 
December 2024. 
    g.  Use of EAW is mandatory, in line with reference (b). 
    h.  PMK-EE.  In line with reference (c), PMK-EE remains mandatory once per paygrade for all E7 
candidates to be eligible for NWAE cycle participation, including EP and Limited Duty Officer 
(LDO) candidates.  Waivers are normally not approved without extraordinary circumstances. 
    i.  ELD course completion is a required prerequisite for taking a NWAE in line with reference 
(d).  E7 candidates must complete the Advanced Leader Development Course (ALDC).  Special 
Warfare Operator (SO) and Special Boat Operator (SB) Sailors must complete the Naval 
Special Warfare Leading Petty Officer (LPO), or Naval Special Warfare Development Group LPO 
courses in lieu of ALDC.
