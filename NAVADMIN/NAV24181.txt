SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY26-1 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD// 
 
REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/06JAN21// 
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62E, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School (USNTPS) Selection Board on 14 November 2024.  This board will select 
highly qualified Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers (NFO) for 
USNTPS.  Test Pilot School (TPS) graduates have significant and long-lasting 
influence on platforms and systems that directly impacts the future 
warfighting capability of the Fleet. 
Request command and Fleet community assistance to identify candidates with 
strong operational performance and ideally, strong academic backgrounds in 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields of study. 
 
2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a signed command-endorsed 
application in line with reference (a), must be received by MyNavy Career 
Center (MNCC) no later than 18 October 2024. 
Additional documentation (including Wing/CAG endorsements, letters of 
recommendation, Fitness Reports (FITREP), etc.) will be accepted until  
1 November 2024, but must be submitted by the applicant, as a letter to the 
board, in line with subparagraph 4a below.  The e-mail address(es), phone 
number(s), college transcripts, Anthropometric Data Measurement Record, a 
current Physical Readiness Training and Body Composition Assessment report 
from Physical Readiness Information Management System Two, last FITREP and 
post-TPS test squadron assignment preferences of the applicant must be 
included with the application.  Current contact information (ashore/afloat) 
of Commanding Officer must also be included to expedite notification, if 
selected. 
 
3.  The command endorsement shall explicitly state whether the applicant, if 
selected, will be allowed and available to report for pre-arrival training by 
the following dates: 
    a.  1 February 2025 for Fixed Wing and CMV-22B pilots 
    b.  1 April 2025 for Rotary Wing pilots 
    c.  1 May 2025 for NFOs 
Endorsements with availability dates after these respective dates may be 
removed from consideration and not reviewed by the board. 
Inability for the applicant to meet the above date may be mitigated by 
conducting initial training in a Temporary Additional Duty (TEMADD) status at 
the expense of the endorsing command.  If this is required, it must be 
explicitly stated in the command endorsement that the endorsing command will 
provide TEMADD funds until the applicant can officially detach.  If the 
applicant has official change of duty orders and is projected to be on board 
the gaining command prior to the board convening date of 14 November 2024, a 
gaining command endorsement is required in addition to the endorsement from 
the applicant's current command.
