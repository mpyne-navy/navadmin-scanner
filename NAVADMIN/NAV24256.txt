RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides implementation and execution guidance for 
Navy's Integrated Primary Prevention Workforce (IPPW), summarizes roles 
and responsibilities, and outlines leader expectations.  Phase-in of the 
IPPW will be complete at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2028, at which time 
the IPPW will be able to support all commands that conduct their own 
Command Climate Assessments (CCA).  IPPW personnel will be assigned to 
multiple units within their area of responsibility to provide 
consultative support.

2.  Navy strives to build tough and resilient teams ready to fight and 
win.  As detailed in reference (a), Culture of Excellence 2.0 is the 
foundation by which the Navy builds Great People, Leaders, and Teams.  
The IPPW, along with Command Climate Specialists (CCS), Command 
Resilience Teams (CRT), Command Managed Equal Opportunity (CMEO) Program 
Managers and other prevention stakeholders, will support commands in 
setting, building, and assessing the foundation to foster healthy command 
climates.  Reference (b) outlines the Department of Defense's (DoD) 
holistic approach for primary prevention of self-directed harm and 
prohibited abusive or harmful acts.  Reference (c) establishes and 
implements policy, assigns responsibilities, prescribes procedures, and 
identifies requirements for addressing primary prevention of harmful 
behaviors and established roles, requirements, training, and education 
standards for prevention personnel.

3.  Navy is phasing in the hiring of ashore and afloat civilian IPPW 
positions to ensure infrastructure is in place across the Fleet, and to 
test fully manned proof-of-concept locations.
    a.  IPPW positions are:  Integrated Prevention Coordinators
(IPC) assigned to Fleets, Type Commands (TYCOM), Regional Commanders, and 
Installation Commanders, as well as Embedded IPCs
(EIPC) (afloat assets).  IPCs are also appointed at Reserve Force
(RESFOR) commands.  Commander, Naval Installations Command (CNIC) 
oversees installation-based IPCs and EIPCs.
    b.  The Regional IPCs are the primary conduit to the installation 
level IPCs. Fleet, TYCOM and operational Reserve component IPCs will 
coordinate with Regional IPCs to ensure information sharing and 
coordination with installation level IPCs.
    c.  Position titles and core roles and responsibilities for position 
descriptions are standardized across organizational levels within both 
Active Duty and Reserve Forces for consistency across the Navy.

4.  Overarching roles and responsibilities of the IPPW:
    a.  Strategic Level (Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), 
Fleet Staffs, Commander, Naval Reserve Force (CNRF), and Commander, Naval 
Installations Command (CNIC)) will:
        (1)  Develop guidance and policy for execution at all levels 
based on primary prevention research and in collaboration with other 
strategic level stakeholders.
        (2)  Conduct robust primary prevention research to develop 
training materials, develop policy and guidance, and inform leadership 
and stakeholders.
        (3)  Collect and analyze data on the implementation and 
evaluation of prevention activities.
        (4)  Translate findings into policy and guidance.
        (5)  Utilize data to prioritize and gauge prevention efforts and 
resource needs to inform Navy Comprehensive Integrated Primary Prevention 
(N-CIPP) plans, which will be comprised of CCA Command Executive 
Summaries and Plans of Actions and Milestones (POAMs).
        (6)  Grant Defense Climate Portal access to certain IPPW 
personnel based on roles and responsibilities (by designated strategic 
level IPPW personnel).
        (7)  Connect resources to meet identified need areas.
        (8)  Collaborate with stakeholders where it aligns with roles and 
responsibilities.
        (9)  Provide tools and technical assistance to operational IPCs, 
commands, and hiring managers to expand knowledge of primary prevention 
frameworks and programming.
        (10)  Advise strategic level leadership.
        (11)  Facilitate collaboration among operational IPCs.
        (12)  Comply with Level 5 credentialing, training, and education 
requirements, and submit an application to the DoD Credentialing Program 
for Prevention Personnel (D-CPPP) within 90 days of onboarding.
    b.  Operational Level (TYCOMs, CNIC Regions, Commander, Naval Air 
Force Reserve and Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command, Commander, 
Naval Information Force Reserve) will:
        (1)  Coordinate activities and provide tools and technical 
assistance to ensure prevention activities at the tactical level are 
aligned with strategic guidance.  Operational level IPCs will provide 
strategic guidance within their area of responsibility and act as 
consultants, advising leadership, analyzing data, and collaborating with 
key stakeholders.  Coordination across operational level IPCs is required 
to ensure tactical level IPCs receive necessary support.
        (2)  Apply strategic guidance to organizational sphere of 
influence.
        (3)  Provide tools and technical assistance to prevention 
professionals at the tactical level.
        (4)  Utilize data to prioritize and gauge prevention efforts and 
resource needs to inform N-CIPP plans.
        (5)  Collect and analyze data on the implementation and 
evaluation of prevention activities.

within 90 days of onboarding.  Additional training can be sought with 
supervisor approval.
    c.  Tactical Level (Installations, Reserve Region Readiness and 
Mobilization Commands (REDCOM), and EIPCs) will:
        (1)  Execute the primary prevention process and work with Command 
Triads, CCSs, CRTs, Family Readiness Programs, and other prevention 
enablers.  These IPCs make up the installation and REDCOM based 
workforce.  In the absence of tactical level IPCs, additional prevention 
enablers, such as the CCS/CMEO Program Managers, will collaborate with 
Regional IPCs to provide assistance when available and appropriate.
        (2)  EIPCs are tactical level afloat assets whose 
responsibilities include consultation to leadership and support of 
implementation of prevention activities.  EIPCs support afloat and 
waterfront primary prevention activities and programming.
        (3)  Utilize data to prioritize and gauge prevention efforts and 
resource needs and inform unit level CCA, for the N-CIPP plan.
        (4)  In collaboration with CRTs, collect and analyze command

5.  The IPPW will assist commanders in setting, building, and assessing 
the foundation for healthy climates by working with leaders to overcome 
barriers to readiness and enhance protective factors in their 
organization.  In line with references (b) and (c), leaders will:

roles and responsibilities to allow for meaningful evaluation of the 
workforce.
    b.  Ensure IPPW personnel are fully integrated into the organization.
    c.  Provide access to appropriate resources and professional 
development opportunities to meet training and credentialing 
requirements.
    d.  Ensure access to required data to include CCA and DEOCS results.
    e.  Develop and leverage collaborative relationships to facilitate 
prevention activities.
    f.  Support implementation of research-based prevention activities.
    g.  Ensure fully operating CRTs, in line with reference (d).  In line 
with reference (e), the CRT will administer the CCA for the organization 
and will collaborate with IPPW personnel in their consultative support 
for CCAs and N-CIPP plans in their areas of responsibility.
