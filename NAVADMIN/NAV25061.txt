SUBJ/COMMEMORATION OF THE BATTLE OF OKINAWA 80TH ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE TO THE 
FLEET//

RMKS/1.  On April 1, 2025 we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Battle 
of Okinawa, one of the most significant and intense battles in our Navy's 
history.  This battle exemplifies the extraordinary courage, determination, 
and sacrifice of those who served and laid down their lives for our nation.

2.  The Battle of Okinawa was a pivotal moment in World War II, commencing on 
April 1, 1945, and lasting until June 22, 1945.  Our resolute Sailors and 
Marines faced tremendous adversity to secure this strategically vital island, 
which played a crucial role in the Pacific campaign.

3.  The Battle of Okinawa was the largest and most costly battle in U.S naval 
history.  In order to support the protracted ground campaign on the island, 
U.S ships were forced to remain in range of several thousand enemy aircraft 
for weeks at a time.  The price of victory was extremely high in the face of 
a determined and resourceful enemy.  More than 4,900 U.S Sailors were killed 
and over 4,800 wounded, with 36 ships sunk and 368 damaged, mostly due to 
kamikaze suicide attacks.  Additionally, more than 760 U.S Navy aircraft were 
lost.

4.  As we honor this historic event, we remember with profound respect the 
valor and dedication of our predecessors.  Their unwavering commitment to 
duty remains an enduring inspiration for all who wear the uniform.

5.  On this 80th anniversary, MCPON Honea and I encourage all commands to 
reflect on the significance of Okinawa and organize appropriate commemorative 
activities that honor those who fought so valiantly.

6.  Released by ADM J. W. Kilby, Acting Chief of Naval Operations and MCPON 
J. M. Honea, 16th Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
