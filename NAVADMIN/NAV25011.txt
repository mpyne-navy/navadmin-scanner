REF/A/JFMM VOLUME VI, CHAPTER 8//

AMPN/ JOINT FLEET MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2M ELECTRONIC REPAIR CHAPTER// Rmks/1.  
In 1997 the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Logistics) implemented a CNO 
Gold Disk Awards Program.  This program was designed to encourage Fleet 
personnel in the maritime community to develop gold disk test routines and 
repair circuit card assemblies and electronic modules.  The resulting 
benefits have resulted in improved operational readiness of a wide range of 
C5I and HM&E systems in addition to significantly improved OPTAR cost 
avoidance.  The award consists of a letter of Commendation signed by Deputy 
CNO for Integration of Capabilities and Resources and a military cash award 
of up to $5000.

2.  The cash award criteria is a graduated dollar value dependent upon cost 
avoidance thresholds.  The award program not only rewards the top repair 
technician, but every Technician that meets the following quarterly cost 
avoidance thresholds:
$150k to $199k of cost avoidance yields a $2k award $200k to $249k of cost 
avoidance yields a $3k award $250k to $299k of cost avoidance yields a $4k 
award $300k and over of cost avoidance yields a $5k award

3.  The CNO Gold Disk Awards Program is administered by the NAVSEA Miniature 
Microminiature Module Test and Repair (2M MTR) Program Manager.  Fleet 2M MTR 
policy and responsibilities are contained in reference (a).  Gold Disk 
awardees are selected by an awards board at NUWC DETACHMENT FIELD ENGINEERING 
OFFICE NORFOLK.  The selection is based on 2M repair metrics submitted in the 
module test and repair tracking system or verification of recently submitted 
Gold Disk test routine.
